my boyfriend is seeking therapy. he is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. he has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.,"<p>probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents, how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children, and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kids.</p><p>don't allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured. &nbsp;a relatively qualified therapist would never make this call.</p><p>psychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families. &nbsp;you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children, assuming each of you wants children.</p><p>childhood issues, your boyfriend's, anyone's, are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emerge.</p><p>if the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents, the disappointments and hurt from the very early years, will be replaced by better ways of interacting.</p><p><br></p>"
i am on my own with my daughter. i am so worried and stressed about her.,"<p>your instinct to help your daughter, is natural.</p><p>how you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem, or if only you see this from observing her.</p><p>also, her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe.</p><p>if you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems, and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life, then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her.</p><p>if your daughter is in your legal control, then you can locate a counselor nearby, discuss your situation with that person, and depending on the outcome, you'd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor.</p><p>starting therapy without willingness to do so, is risky. &nbsp;the person may feel resentful enough to not participate. &nbsp; and, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patient's self-interest and engage them in therapy.</p><p>family counseling, regardless of your daughter's age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter's attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter's psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.</p><p>also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response.</p><p><br></p>"
i've been with the mother of my child for years.,<p>i would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better. &nbsp;i would suggest that you get to know yourself. &nbsp; what do you need in a relationship? &nbsp;what is holding you to this relationship other than your child? &nbsp;what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect? &nbsp;just a few questions to ask yourself..</p>
"sometimes, i'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. i've always thought it was normal and i was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself.","<p>first, be aware that each end every one of us has anxiety at some point. that certainly seems to fit what you're describing here, but that doesn't mean you have an anxiety disorder, necessarily. that's where there is a difference. anyone who has a hard time with public speaking or feels uncomfortable in large crowds, for example, is experiencing anxiety.</p><p>it sounds like it would be helpful to look at the differences between the days when you are more comfortable on the days that you are not. if you notice your anxiety is keeping you from doing things that you need or want to do, it may be helpful to talk with and mental health professional.</p><p>i wonder also whether your appetite and sleeping patterns are the same or similar to how they were before you experienced this anxiety, when your anxiety started, and whether you feel more comfortable when someone you trust is there with you.</p><p>if you have an idea of times or situations in which you feel anxious, consider carrying a small smooth rock or another object that makes you feel calm and centered. perhaps you can keep it in your pocket and remember specific comfortable times while you have it in your hand.</p>"
it does waste a lot of money and my friends keep bugging me to quit.,"you’re starting to see some of the reasons why quitting might be a good idea. you realize that smoking is pretty expensive and you've started thinking about how else you could spend that money. you know that smoking is a waste of money. saving money and your health while pleasing your friends are all excellent reasons to quit. sounds like you have a lot of support for quitting. could you find something you want to buy with all the money you'll save by quitting? wasting money is a point of view for each person, but always do what is good for you and for everyone. listen to your friends and try to save that money. i think quitting would be best for your health, try small steps toward your goal."
"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and i just had my first kiss five months ago. i’m worried that, at this rate, i won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, i don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. i feel dirty by doing this, but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking. i am tall, i play lots of sports, and i get excellent grades in school. i am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. it bothers me. most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. i feel like i will be single forever sometimes.","<p>it is very hard to want a loving relationship, and either see or imagine all around you, the great times other couples are having. extra hard is that other people's comments may start giving you the sense that you are letting them down to not have a relationship!</p><p>all the fantasies that develop from viewing facebook photos and imagining everyone or most people in ideal relationships, just augments any frustration of not being part of this group.</p><p>your post sounds like you're being true to yourself and honoring who you are really, by developing clear standards of what you'd expect from a relationship.</p><p>for the longterm, whatever develops in your relationship life, you will always be able to look back and know you had self-integrity.&nbsp;<br></p><p>by being your natural self, you're being attractive. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>probably very unlikely that a young woman who would like a relationship, will never have one.</p><p>maybe the young men in your school are not yet emotionally mature enough to know how to see and appreciate you.</p><p>even though it may be hard, have patience with bringing in someone who is good for you. &nbsp;</p><p>and, continue your keen insight of yourself because it is guiding you to be the best in all areas of living.</p><p>sending good luck in all areas!</p><p><br></p>"
sometimes 3 times a night.,"<p>as a depth therapist (aka ""psychodynamic practitioner""), i do a lot of dream work with clients; and they gain great insights from our explorations.</p><p>we remember dreams, i believe, because dreams are messages (always in code) from the unconscious, communicating the crux of unresolved conflict between who we are and who we think we are supposed to be. you might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messages...and make some internal changes in response.</p><p>write them down! you'll be glad you did. a broad cross-section of these these messages will help your therapist help you interpret the meanings of these communications from you to you, and possibly chart your best path forward toward to resolve the cause of psychological symptoms you might be experiencing.</p>"
i get really mad easily at my parents and family.,"<p>anger is not necessarily a bad thing. if you are angry and you can talk about your feelings, that would be very helpful. anger usually comes along with something else, like feeling sad, worried, overwhelmed, confused, and many others. consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point. if you get along well with friends and don't get angry with them, look at the differences. do you feel criticized by your parents or family? misunderstood? there could be any number of things.</p><p>i wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly. try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry. anger is a real emotion in itself. it almost always connects to something else as well.</p>"
"of course, i have to quit at some point, but now is just not the time. i know what it’s like to go through the withdrawal and it’s pretty awful. i was able to quit a few years ago, with the help of that gum, but with my wife losing her job and having to work so much overtime, i don’t think i have the energy to deal with it right now.","cigarettes are something that eventually you're going to give up for good. it's not a question of if you'll quit, the question is more about when you'll quit.  you have a lot of experience with quitting. you've tried to quit before and were successful. once you're ready, you'll be able to pull from what you know to be successful again.  now doesn't seem like a great time to quit. we can find ways to increase your energy and motivation. with your wife not working, she has time to help you stay quit this time.  how can you afford it with your wife not working? there are ways to help quit that make it easier. having substitutes, a diary, or someone to talk to when cravings get rough are just a few tips. the moment will never come if you think this way, the action is up to you. yes and the important thing is to stay focused day by day"
sometimes i get so angry at her i just hit out. she doesn’t push back so it never gets serious. i’m lucky i guess.  she knows she’s in the wrong.,it makes sense to you to use physical force to keep your girlfriend in line. you might be more concerned about it if she retaliated but since it never gets that serious it’s not that big of a deal. sometimes you're so overwhlemed with emotion that you lash out. you hit your girlfriend when she makes a mistake. there's never an excuse for violence. who taught you it's ok to hit a woman? never do this in assaulting a person and this is totally out of place. do not hit because you could hurt her. stop and count to ten in an effort to difuse the situation. please be kind to her. it is very important to show your affection to the person who is very kind to you.
"a year ago, the love of my life left me and never looked back. our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart. i miss her so much and can't seem to get over  being so heartbroken.","<p>i recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life. at the same time, i don't understand whether you are able to see your son. i'm curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your son's mother.</p><p>when you say that she ""never looked back,"" i imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested in.</p><p>i would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much. most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died, but it also applies to people who have a significant loss, whether that is a relationship, a job, or any number of other things.</p><p>in the meantime, try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus on.</p>"
"i think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. we just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. he doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

 i have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. how do i help him?",<p>how do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?</p><p>what do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?</p><p>to answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.</p>
"i can’t believe that i’m the one in here. i’m not the bully. not like my other friends, they’re rough; they’re much worse than me. this isn’t fair.  i just like to make jokes.  i am a comedian.","you think you’re being treated unfairly and that someone else is responsible for causing the problem. compared to your friends, you don't think you're too bad.  you are the comedian in your group of friends. making jokes at someones expense isn't kind. isn't making jokes at someone's expense what a bully is? ok comedian is a talent as long as it's done in a way you want. your important and that's why we are taking the time to discuss when and where to do things."
i need help dealing with stress. how can i handle it all and feel less stressed out?,"<p>in case you feel some relief to know you're feeling the tone of our times.</p><p>we live with crumbling of our values which then gives rise to insecurity everywhere. &nbsp;if someone doesn't know what their values are then its difficult to do anything, and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptions.</p><p>you're more normal for noticing and feeling stressed than if you imagine life felt fine the way it is!</p><p>one road to take is to accept that there are no clear roads forward. &nbsp;this means to change long term goals into shorter ones.</p><p>also, in general the more focused you can be as to your particular wishes, motivations, interests, and people about whom you care, the greater will be your sense of confidence that your personal world is as secure as it can be for right now.</p><p>and, it helps too to know that nothing lasts forever, eventually all of what is up in the air will start to land in a much more clear way.</p>"

"i'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. at the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tim's heart. he is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but i don't really believe him. 

lately, tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. he's been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. but he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. he seems really torn up about it, and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves. 

he knows that i still crush on him. he doesn't rub it in my face. he's a good guy, but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. how do i do that when the time comes? how do i support him and show him that i'm here without wanting to hook up? how do i make him feel better? he is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which i think is ridiculous.","<p>first off, i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings,&nbsp;and understanding. regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....i'm not sure if that is possible. if you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. good luck to you!<br></p>"
"i have a lot of issues going on right now. first of all, i have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights i sleep too much and still feel quite tired. i’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. is there something wrong with me and if so what should i do?","<p>hi there. i have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling. a lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be.</p><p>first off, what stressors do you have in your life right now? financial, relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. they can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all. </p><p>secondly, do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family? some of the symptoms listed here in this question (i.e. trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, too much sleep, anger &amp; anxiety) are all common symptoms of depression. often times, these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for &#34;just being tired.&#34; </p><p>furthermore, it's important to ask yourself, if you are feeling worthless, problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. if you are having these symptoms, please seek help immediately. </p><p>lastly, considering your stated symptoms i would recommend reaching out to your doctor for further consult. it's always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better!  do some helpful tips for the your doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits (i.e. how much or little are you sleeping), make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks. </p><p>i hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you.</p>"

you have to put solids in her bottle right away so she can sleep better.,"it's important to you to be the best parent you can be, and part of that means making sure your child gets enough sleep.  putting solids in her bottle makes sense to you. you've found that your child sleeps better if you add baby cereal to her formula bottle. you put solids in your baby's bottle. feeding your baby solids before they're ready is very dangerous, increasing risk for many diseases like obesity or sids. where did you hear that? this is not always correct, sleeping better involves several other factors. this is not good advice at all. babies are not ready for food until 6 months and putting it in their bottle is a choking hazard. furthermore, sleeping is developmental and really has nothing to do with how much stuff you pack into their little tummies. i'm not exactly sure what you mean by that statement."

"no matter how much people say they understand. they don’t, they have no goddamn idea what is like there, it was hell and they don’t really want to hear it, so i don’t tell them.","you don’t think others will ever really understand what you dealt with over there so you’ve found that it’s really easier to just keep everything to yourself. what you experienced over there seems surreal. you'd like to open up and tell someone what you experienced to feel understood, but part of you also wants to protect others by keeping it to yourself.  you experienced hell over there. you don't have to talk to just anyone. you can talk to healthcare professionals that understand and can help. i think you should meet with a therapist. have you tried talking to a mental health professional? sometimes you think they don't want to hear from you, but just try or start, sometimes that's the initial step. i know it was a difficult situation that few people can truly understand. if you have someone in your life that you can trust, it still may be helpful to talk about it, even if they don't know firsthand what you went through. you know that you can confide in me, i will do my best to understand."
"i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. in the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. we argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. i used to party a lot, and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else. these situations were never more than just kissing. i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. i love him so much and want to work things out too, but i'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. i can't seem to forgive myself. i'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.","<p>hi cerritos,</p><p>this is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. you are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. you don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. you only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? were you shamed as a child? did you learn that you deserved to be punished? did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. the bar is too high for you. if i was your therapist, i would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound.&nbsp;</p><p>if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. forgiving doesn't mean ""it was okay""; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>you have done many things here that you can feel proud of! you've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. you are acting very honourably. it's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. it's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.</p><p>i wish you growth and happiness.</p>"

"i've worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it.

i'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","<p>it sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations - which is understandable. on the one hand you want to get over him, on the other you are still holding out hope for something more. it will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more. if you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system - that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him. if you are whole-heartedly committed to moving past the <a href=""http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/articles/what-is-sex-therapy"">sexual and romantic parts of your relationship</a> and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start. it is hard to ""just be friends"" when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins.&nbsp;</p>"

"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.
the other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.

i don't know what to do. i need some closure or i'm not going to be able to move on from this. i don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. i’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. he’s such a good person. i also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but i can't get it out of my head. i'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but i can't sleep because my mind is racing. i've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.

i want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but i don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. if he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. if my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. on one hand, i want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. where would i go from there? on the other hand, i feel like i can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but i don't want to.

please help me, because i really have no idea what to do.","<p>if you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. although you say you're happy, i'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. that's a pretty important element to be missing.</p><p>it may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. if you feel the need to see what is possible there, i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. you can't have everything.</p><p>if you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. the grass isn't greener... a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future.</p>"
"i recently went through a divorce. my ex-husband called my sister saying bad things about me. my sister never defended me. now that i showed the truth, she's shutting me up and saying she doesn't care about the fight. why didn't she convey that to him from the beginning?","<p>unfortunately, i can't tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that way.</p><p>i can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved. while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it, the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics. also, a lot of people don't act the same way around extended family (or other people) as they do at home behind closed doors, so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in it.</p><p>i wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister, how she is treating you, how you feel around her now, etc. i do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now, but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship, you could find a time when you could ask about this (why she didn't convey that to him from the beginning) in a way that is calm, not defensive, and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister, not looking to defend yourself at that moment. if that conversation can happen, it may be quite a difficult one, so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation, it's not about you, but is about where she was coming from. after you think you understand that (i'm saying that you understand where she's coming from, not that you agree with what she's saying), you could see if she's willing to listen to how you feel about it.</p>"

"" being responsible"" for someone doesn't mean you have to pay their bills, it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need. that care may be placement in a long-term care facility like a group home or a nursing home. psych inpatient hospitals aren't long-term, so you do need to look into other long-term options. psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him, they're not where someone stays forever.</p><p>good luck, and keep up the good attitude! work with his treatment team. ask for a social worker. if they see family that is wanting to do the right thing and wanting to help, they'll help you even if it does take a while to get things sorted out. the worst thing any of you can do is not go to appointments and that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>"

"how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have?  what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? i've read about this online, but i'd like to understand this from a therapist's point of view.","<p>this is a great question, and i am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach. when i am determining what type of personality a client has, i take my time and really absorb their lens/ point of view to themselves and others. determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and building rapport. after taking time to get to know them, and learning about their view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pick-up on more specific personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. clinicians, including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent, which indicate a type of personality. for example, if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning, and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the ""type a personality"".&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">in addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the dsm-5/ icd-10.&nbsp;</span></p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>hello. the end of the counselor/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. among them are the client's inability to make forward progress in therapy; the clinician's inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons); a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided; or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. in this last case, a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client's inability to pay. that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client, which in itself should be paramount.</p><p>when the client and therapist decide that services are done, it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur, and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well, those this is perhaps not as important). this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. in this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.</p><p>i have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that i learned years ago during graduate school: ""not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist."" it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients. the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. in these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.</p><p>ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. if both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.</p>"

"my wife and i are newly married, about 2 months. we've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. she's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but i think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. our sex life has suffered as a result.
tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm i've ever encountered. i was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. i don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. please help.","<p>you are newly married, you have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. what if you take the focus (hint: pressure) off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. you know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating.  it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay. spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection, i wrote a post about this a while back, you can find it here: http://connectfulness.com/little-moments/ and have fun with it! </p>"

"i've worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it.

i'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","<p>it sounds like a tricky situation. if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him, getting over him may not be possible. what makes it even trickier is that his actions (hugs and touching) may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible. some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light. if you truly want to force yourself to get over him, cutting contact&nbsp;or setting strict boundaries may be necessary. if you don't see him, over time you can begin to forget about him. if you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches, you will not feel mislead or&nbsp;have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested.&nbsp;it would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings&nbsp;to change. thus, being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him. good luck!&nbsp;<br></p>"

"sometimes i can't stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. 
when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. 
am i crazy? i don't think these thoughts are normal.","<p>religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic, and these types of questions, especially around heaven, hell, and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult &amp; confusing feelings. what i want to focus on is the fear &amp; anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions. scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they're out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but i want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic &amp; anxiety.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: georgia, times, 'times new roman', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. i also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. so, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen, he wrote the book buddha's brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. there are reasons that our brain works this way, but i don't have time to go into all of that in this response. so, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, &nbsp;this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.&nbsp;i would also suggest when you're having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how you're breathing. often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full, deep breath or what is called belly breathing. if you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths, bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale, just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins. </span></p>"

why bother? the other family in our house won’t put a tv timer on their tv and our kids just go to the living room to watch with them.,sharing living space and trying to set boundaries at the same time can seem nearly impossible when the other family isn’t on the same page. finding a balanace between your family's rules and the other family's rules is a huge struggle. you can't control what the other family does. try talking to the other mom to see if you can agree on tv time. have you tried telling your kids not to go into the living room? see what is healthier and that is a more united family. maybe you could discuss the tv timer with the other family and come to an agreement. so control your kids. it's not their responsibility to limit what they do in their own time because of your kids

we've been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker. i don't know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.,"<p>i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. these questions help couples to build connection and trust. it's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. if he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. if he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.</p><p><br></p><p>dr. virginia chow</p><p>www.psychologyresource.ca</p>"

"i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. i had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. i am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend.  they also have a daughter together. my issue is that there is always drama. i am pregnant, and i told my ex-boyfriend that i don't want any drama or arguments. i want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. however, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. that led to an argument. i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter. my stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. i especially told him i didn't want to be involved. somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.

the point is there is so much drama. i try my best to get along with everyone. i don't understand where i went wrong (besides replying back to his question). i feel like i'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. i had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. in my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. i was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which i have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","<p>hi. i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.&nbsp;children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they don't like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. your ex-boyfriend&nbsp;seems more focused on his own needs. in fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on 'parental alienation'. i agree this is a problem.</p><p>i also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. it's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. honour this instinct you have.&nbsp;</p><p>i will suggest a few things to you. first, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. it will help you feel supported.</p><p>know that your ex's behaviours aren't happening because you did anything wrong; it's the way he operates (and maybe this is why you're not with him?). you can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. you're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.</p><p>keep on defining clear boundaries! you might sound like a broken record (""you'll have to talk to my husband about that""), but that's okay. it's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. it's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. it's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. it's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.</p><p>regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing (""our agreement states x, and you are not following our agreement""). your daughter doesn't have to be aware; i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.</p><p>a professional therapist can help you with all of this. i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)</p><p><br></p>"
i heard from my cousin that the covid vaccine makes you sterile.,"you are concerned about some of the side effects of the cv vaccine, especially since you've heard it may impact your ability to have children. you want to have kids one day. since you've heard that the vaccine may make you sterile, you're worried that it might not be a great choice for you. you've heard the covid vaccine may prevent you from having kids. there's no research to support that's true. do you want to get pregnant and then die because you're not vaccinated? that is a genuine concern but there is no evidence to support that claim. so you have no reason to worry about it. it is in the paperwork that they do not know the effects of the shot on fertility. i would suggest you read through the fact sheets about it and make an informed decision. that's not proved by science. that is kind of rumor."

what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","talking to a licensed profession who can discuss this in greater depth can be best.&nbsp;<div>as a general information, in short, i can say that our thoughts are greatly influenced&nbsp;by our early life experiences. our thoughts are processed through schemes, these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us. &nbsp;while our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults, however, we are not condemned to abide by them for life, in psychotherapy, you learn to change negative&nbsp;schemas with positive ones. yeah, if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to self-sabotage your efforts for success and happiness. the research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind. on the other hand, in psychotherapy you can learn helpful&nbsp;strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits.&nbsp;</div><div>yoga, meditation, and tai&nbsp;chi are also found to increase self-awareness and lessen the intrusions of negative self-judgment on one's&nbsp;psyche.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div></div>"
