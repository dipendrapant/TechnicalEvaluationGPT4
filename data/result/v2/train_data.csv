"i met a guy a while ago, and i can't stop thinking about him. i feel like i love him, but i don't think i know him. what if he is not who i think he is? i cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. i don't know, am i too obsessive? every time we talk though, it's like magic. he makes me feel amazing, but what if i'm mistaken?","<p>keller, it sounds like you're living this relationship in your mind, instead of in the real world. you can get answers to your questions by talking to him...getting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have. you're asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship.&nbsp;</p><p>so what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him? fear of rejection? fear of something else? if you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships, i recommend a therapist to help you work through that. i wish you well. :)</p>"
"on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs.  i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. 

how do i fix this?","<p>i get how you feel; you wish your body looked different and you're embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice.&nbsp;</p><p>you don't say how old you are. it's likely that, if you are young, your body will change as you mature, but in general, we're given the bodies we're given and i'm glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is. you seem to want to stop disguising it. bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what her's looks like. many men go through this as well, although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how we're supposed to look.&nbsp;</p><p>young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them. in fact, other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatever's going on with you.&nbsp;</p><p>i suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear, and if someone is rude enough to comment on it, you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and they'll get the hint. but my bet is they won't even notice. :)</p>"
"my wife works late most days, so i'm lonely. i love my wife with all my heart, however i don't feel the intimacy we used to have. we don't have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. i have become close friends with a coworker, which i know is not helping. nothing will happen with that, but there’s the thought.","<p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"">first things first! &nbsp;friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing there's sexual attraction. and entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target.&nbsp; careful with that friendship! you do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person. &nbsp;even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection. &nbsp;ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship&nbsp;like that.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%;"">then try to refocus on your marriage. i suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns. &nbsp;ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them. &nbsp;make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day. &nbsp;remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.</span></p><p class=""msonormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 8.35pt; line-height: 21.75pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;""><span style=""color: rgb(46, 116, 181); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17pt; line-height: 107%;"">¿cómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span lang=""es-pr"" style=""font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 56, 56); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"">mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días, la amo con todo mi corazón, pero no siento la intimidad como antes.&nbsp; ya no tenemos sexo, lo cual me molesta tremendamente.&nbsp; me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo, lo cual no ayuda.&nbsp; nada pasara, pero hay pensamientos al respecto.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""color: rgb(59, 56, 56); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%;"">primero lo primero! las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual. entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande.&nbsp; ¡ten cuidado con esa amistad! no quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona.&nbsp; aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexión especial, compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun. pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad así.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""color: rgb(59, 56, 56); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%;"">intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio. &nbsp;sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento.&nbsp; pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse, sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas.&nbsp; hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes, hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos, y comunicarse durante el día, aunque sea con textos.&nbsp; recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión.</span></p>"
"whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting. i say mean things to let my anger out. whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality. i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. i hurt the ones i love with my words. i want to be better for myself and them.","<p>congratulations on making your way to step one, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.</p><p>there is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.</p><p>start on the inside track of your own heart and mind. &nbsp;once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.</p><p>for example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.</p><p>basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.</p><p>also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.</p><p>be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.</p>"
with giving up salt i’m peeing all the time. can’t be too far from a bathroom or i start to worry. i wonder if this is normal.,"all the trips to the bathroom have begun to interfere with your ability to carry out your life. you're trying to figure out a way to reduce the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. you've been having a lot of accidents. your anxiety is adding to your symptoms. i think you should speak to a therapist who uses cbt to gain control for your anxiety. do you wear a liner? it sounds like this may occupy a lot of your thoughts. i would say that is a bit worrisome. i would recommend to try to ascertain if your symptoms are equivalent to the situation. take it easy, you will soon be able to control this problem, don't be anxious. it might be normal as your body adjusts to the dietary change and is flushing some of the water weight your body may have been holding on to.  if it continues more than a week or two, i would make an appointment with your doctor, just to be safe."
"it takes me a long time to fall asleep; i’d estimate about two hours. i often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.

i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. i was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.

after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. however in the past couple months, i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. how can i solve this issue?","<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

</p><p class=""msonormal"">you’re noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep, there
is quite a bit going on, which may be anxiety related. it sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up, the difficulty with your father’s business,
and your mother’s health issues. these connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you. there is no exact science to
dreams, but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives. i think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress, trouble sleeping, and frightening dreams.</p>

"a friend of mine taking psychology advised i go to my doctor to check if i have major depressive disorder. i'm afraid of the consequences of doing so. if i do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder, won’t that go on my records? i will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things i may be prohibited from. i’m also afraid of taking any anti-depressants. this year, my doctor gave me some for a ""dislocated hip."" i had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them. everyone i know who has taken anti-depressants says it’s a bad idea all around and you’re better getting treatment without them. i’m concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because i am unable to make decisions on my own. i’m not really suicidal, but i am not really taking care of myself either. someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy. i’m not keen on that. i’m wondering if i am better off just getting self-help and working things out on my own. it’s just that i've been an emotional mess since i was in elementary school. i’ve graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy, but i cannot deny i still am not good.","<p>i admire your courage for stating your view about anti-depressants. &nbsp;questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views, are signs of strength and clarity in a person.</p><p>as a therapist, i always tell my patients to avoid anti-depressants.</p><p>their effectiveness is in suppressing a person's mood and feelings. &nbsp;if someone does not know how they are feeling, then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves, their uncertainties and hesitations, and overall, how they relate to others and what they expect from others.</p><p>anti-depressants mask how someone feels.</p><p>in a crisis, temporarily taking anti-depressants may be helpful. &nbsp;if someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning, then &nbsp;suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day, may be of benefit for a short while.</p><p>basically, respect and follow your own opinion about anti-depressants. &nbsp; your view is shared by many. &nbsp; it is a minority opinion, and very valid.&nbsp;</p><p>if you would like to shop for a therapist, ask the person on the phone, what their opinions are about anti-depressants.</p><p>ideally, you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you, or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic.</p><p>i hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search!</p>"
i’ve had other friends who also had an abnormal afp test and their babies were fine.  it makes me less certain i need the amniocentesis.,"you’ve heard mixed messages about whether or not an amniocentesis is necessary for you. you’re starting to wonder what’s the best path forward for you. you're not completly confident that it's moving forward with the amniocentesis. you're not sure amniocentesis will help you know if your baby is fine. i don't know the health histories of your friends, but i do know amniocentesis is medically indicated for you pregnancy. feels like a no brainer.  why would you not get one? you shouldn't base your decision just on how your friends' babies ended up. you need what an expert tells you. have you spoken to your medical doctor about this concern?"
"i told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. she started crying because i wouldn't make her daddy die.","<p>toddlers don't have the intellectual capacity to conceptualize.</p><p>better to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddler.</p><p>a person must be around 9, possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present time.</p><p>pretty much your toddler demonstrated to you here age appropriate and limited understanding of the loss of a parent, by crying that you weren't able to magically make her father disappear.</p><p>also, please pay attention and form your own opinions as to the reasons why your toddler would wish her father's death.</p><p>she may be pointing out that the father behaves in frightening or harmful ways towards her.</p>"
"i've been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. i haven't been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years.

how can i deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","<p>to be bullied is very painful.</p><p>i'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.</p><p>depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?</p><p>bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.</p><p>if you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?</p><p>in case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.</p><p>you're entitled to be protected by your school.</p>"
"i have a mother who is still running my life even though i'm almost 30 years old. i want to move out and live my own life, but it feels like as long as i do what my mom wants our relationship is okay. it's never okay if i don't do what she wants. 

i don't know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about  whether it's right in her eyes.  would it help for me to talk to someone about this?","<p>if the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels ""okay"" is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life, then this only seems ok.</p><p>in fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done, does not have their own ability to think for themselves.</p><p>separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters, from your mother's point of view, may be difficult.</p><p>first, realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself.</p><p>you'll need practice until you feel comfortable.</p><p>unless, if you've been thinking through decisions you'd like to make and the idea of your mother's anger is the only point which stopped you, then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life.</p><p>basically, it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest.</p>"
"i think that it may become difficult to stay smoke free once i return to work. there is a ritual in the office, it’s how we start the days and take breaks. i could not guarantee that once i return to work and the baby is all grown up i won’t start again. but definitely not now, while i am breastfeeding and around the little one all day.","you feel strongly that it’s important not to smoke now while you’re breastfeeding and at home with your baby but you’re unsure how you’re going to keep up the momentum once you’re back to work and around your co-workers. you want to stay smoke-free once you return to work. you're realizing that you'll need a plan in place before heading back so that you're prepared for the daily office rituals that can lead to smoking. staying quit is going to be hard once you go back to work. you see you don't need to smoke since you're not smoking at home. you should be able to not smoke once you return to work. if you can not smoke at home, what's the big deal about also not smoking at work? don't give in to the peer pressure. they don't know what's best for you. you re really strong, but i am sure you will always be capable of choosing what is best for your son: remember his health! overcome the addiction and you will see that you will have a much better life and overcome the problems with other things like physical activities."
"i know i'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make.  i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life, but i just can't seem to even though i really want to. why can't i force myself to change?","<p>in general the reason people aren't able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to change.</p><p>what the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotions.</p><p>if you haven't got someone like this in your life, which is common, then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they are.</p><p>be patient with yourself too. &nbsp;change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change.</p>"
"if a buff guy wants to go bareback, it is really hard to say no to that. i don’t get that many model types, and i don’t want to blow it.","you fear that you might be rejected if you try to be clear about your boundaries and need for protection. you don't see yourself as being on the same level as some of the 'model' types you've dated. because of that power difference, it's hard to stand up for what you believe in.  you usually go along with what the other guy wants to do. you feel more desirable when you give in to what an attractive guy wants. you should stand up for yourself and your health. you're valuable. have you talked to your therapist about your low self-esteem? i understand how you feel, but that’s not the right approach. it can be the buff guy that is sleeping around with a lot of people who is going to give you that sti. think patiently and always plot what should be done and you will reap the results. have you considered speaking with the model directly about your concerns?"
"i get so sick of trying to get my meds. i go to the pharmacy and they say i can’t get them because i am over my 6 limit but to come back. then i go back and then i have to wait and wait. then the next week it’s the same thing. it’s ridiculous, if he wants me to take them then he better make sure that i can get them. besides, i heard that it’s ok if you miss your meds sometimes, that your body stores them up for you.”","you are furious that you can’t reliably get your meds at the pharmacy. you would like to take your medications, but it is too frustrating when you can’t get your refills. you're not entirely sold on why taking your medications as prescribed is so important. you don't like dealing with the pharmacy to get your meds refilled. you're not taking your medication schedule very seriously. taking your medication as prescribed is a requirement, not a recommendation.   you think your body stores your meds? well, it depends on the meds. however, you can always order online. the site you use will contact the doctor for you for authorization if you provide the contact info. calm down, go to a doctor and only use the medications that were prescribed, don't stress about a few things. it's best to follow the prescriber's instructions regarding taking your medication. i would suggest calling your pharmacy and asking for advice on how to handle your particular problem."
we've been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker. i don't know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.,"<p>the best way to get an answer is to just ask. i would defintely&nbsp;let him know you are asking out of concern and not to judge or criticize. allow him to explain his answer and see how you feel about it. try to ask him when you both are already discussing other topics and just say, ""can i ask you something?""&nbsp;</p><p>earl lewis</p><p>www.relationshipsgoneright.com</p>"
i was born a girl. i look like a boy. i sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. i don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. i just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"<p>it is ok to tell someone who is casually asking about your gender, what is written on your birth certificate.&nbsp;</p><p>measure the significance of your answer to the significance of the person who is asking you the question.</p><p>in addition, you are stating the simple truth, so there's nothing wrong with stating what is on your birth certificate.</p><p>do you understand the reason of why people are asking about your gender?</p><p>it is not a common question, so i wonder about the context in which this happens.</p><p>the whole field of gender identity is extremely popular now.</p><p>popular usually means people are swept into a trend just because it is in the air, not because they've given the time and seriousness to thoughtfully consider if the trend has anything to do with them personally.</p><p>keep open minded to who you are, including if you are truly a different gender than the one you're born into.</p><p>it is a very complicated question and lately people, especially teens, are answering it much more rapidly than seems possible to fully consider.</p>"
how does a person start the counseling process?,"<p>the easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online. a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful. there are lots of counselors out there to choose from, so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that. check out their website, social media, and any reviews (but remember, people are not always very nice). if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services, look for one that is in your network. you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurance's website. if your coverage isn't that great and you know you're going to be paying for it all anyway (because you're an all-star and verified your coverage already with the insurance company), then you can really pick any counselor you want, but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible. if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once you've started counseling, <a href=""https://getbetter.co/"" target=""_blank"">better</a> is a good option. once you've found a counselor you think is a good fit for you, normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment. with many counselors you can now send an email, but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic. once you're all scheduled, they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in, or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there. from there, all you have to do is show up!</p>"
my mom said that i can’t eat anything after dinner  (which is around 5pm) because all that food goes right to your thighs.,"your mom has a lot of rules about food that she's passed on to you. you're questioning whether or not these rules are actually true. it's frustrating when you get hungry after 5pm but feel like you shouldn't eat anything because of your mom's rule. you don't want more weight on your thighs. unfortunately, your mom is mistaken. digestion and metabolism are complex processes that work different depending on how you feed it. has that been your experience when you've gained weight in the past? that's wrong, you can eat it, as long as it's healthy. well, it is not true .all the food that we eat goes into our stomach but my advice for  you is that you should eat less food at night because the digestive systems works well in day as compared to night. so , you may get fat. have you looked into the validity of this statement? this should be verified by a relevant medical professional."
"my mom and i have been fighting a lot now, and i just want a good relationship with her.","<p>the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively. &nbsp;one of the hardest things about this, however, is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the all-or-nothing blame.&nbsp;</p><p>the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification; why not try asking your mother why this particular fight/situation is eliciting such an angry response. &nbsp;often, the simple act of expressing that we don't understand the other person's point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication. the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times.&nbsp;</p>"
"i was raped a couple months ago, since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, i have been having trouble feeling emotions. it's almost as if i'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. what can i do to change this?","<p>sociopaths don't know they are sociopaths.</p><p>clearly, you realize you have pretty deep emotions and have lived through several severely distressing situations.</p><p>your sense of self may be protecting for a while until you recover the practical aspects of daily life and feel some sense of predictability and stability in your life.</p><p>knowing and feeling disturbing emotions which rupture basic trust that other people are safe, is itself a raw process.</p><p>yes, it is possible to become numb emotionally. &nbsp; the good purpose is to protect you from additional hurt.</p><p>when your inner world feels itself ready, more of your emotions from the recent distressing events will be accessible.</p><p>if many months pass and you see no progress, then definitely consider a few sessions with a therapist who would be able to guide you to become more open to your feelings.</p>"
"i start a diet every day but once i get hungry, i lose my discipline.","you really struggle to stick with your goals when you’re faced with temptation. if you could find a way to control your hunger throughout the day, you might be more successful.  you really struggle with sticking to your weight loss goals when you're hungry. i can prescribe you something to reduce hunger. why can't you stick to your goals? discipline must be paramount, try to control yourself, it only depends on you. my advice in this situation is that you should not think about food when you're on a diet. eat some cucumbers  and other diet food and keep yourself engaged in some activity . this way, you will remain motivated towards yours goal. do you have structure in your plan? or any specific goals?"

"i've been with a man for four years. for the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. his words do not match his actions. i love this man, but it's hurting so much.","<p>this can be difficult and confusing.</p><p>if you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. when that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. he may want to be really good friends. he may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>if you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. then you can switch. also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.</p><p>questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.</p><p>if this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.</p>"
"a lot on my plate, work, school, planning a wedding. things will calm down eventually but i cannot sleep or eat enough now.","you’re feeling anxious by everything going on right now and it’s having an effect on every aspect of your life. you're in survival mode right now. you're not able to eat or sleep because you're so overwhlemed by having too much going on at once. you have a lot on your plate and feel overwhelmed. you can't wait for things to calm down, or you'll be worse off. maybe you can put off your wedding until have you graduate  how much longer can you maintain this pace without proper nutrition or sleep? work can always wait, although they will say that they can't. weddings, unfortunately, are pressing. focus on the wedding and take time for yourself. use some pto. be patient, these things happen to many people, and that is part of it. you have to try to keep annoyances and big future plans in your life at a moderate level and not fall prey to the highs and lows. perhaps you need to ask others for more assistance?"
"i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another. sometimes we come across something that scares us, we push through it and suddenly we aren't afraid anymore. but sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. there are some options:</p><p>1. you can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. what kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. for example, if you have a general phobia about something, they may use various techniques to help you manage it.&nbsp; <br></p><p><br></p><p>2. there are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. when it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias, exposure therapy well-studied and proven to work. a therapist would help you with this, but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself. i am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself, but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools. http://psychology.tools/anxiety.html</p><p><br></p><p>some colleagues may offer you some other types of advice. be well.</p><p>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc<br></p><p><br></p>"
"in particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.","<p>you have an opportunity, but you haven't described a problem. &nbsp;(are you creating one?) &nbsp;many families have various members who have different spiritual beliefs and religious practices. &nbsp;accepting the idea that those with whom we are close may be different from us is the only way to create a world of peace. &nbsp; this may be a wonderful opportunity to practice tolerance and love. &nbsp;if mutual decisions need to be made in religious contexts, you may also get to practice boundary setting, assertiveness (without aggression), communication skills, and loving kindness. &nbsp;this is a great problem to work through! &nbsp;it is indeed a very spiritual question. &nbsp;blessings to you all, ~mark (www.markmorrislcsw.com and www.livingyes.org)</p>"
what should i do when we see each other?,"<p>i am so sorry that this happened. &nbsp;nobody deserves to be outed without their permission. &nbsp;</p><p>i would encourage you to get in touch with someone who is supportive and accepting and plan to touch base with them after you see your wife's sister. &nbsp;you can also plan to take some time for self care after you see her. &nbsp;for example, if you enjoy bike rides, plan on taking a bike ride afterward. &nbsp;plan to do something that feels nurturing and caring. &nbsp;best of luck!</p>"
"i'm a teenager, and i struggle with going out and talking to people. i feel awful about leaving home. i know i can't afford a therapist so i don't know what my problem is, but i think i might have social anxiety.","<p>if you are noticing that anxiety tends to be triggered around interactions with others, then you may have social anxiety. working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into the nature of the anxiety, develop tools for coping with it, and take steps that may alleviate it over time, so that you can enjoy your interactions with others. <br></p><p>if you are short on money, there still may be options for you to be able to see a therapist. check with your insurance provider about your behavioral health coverage. if you have medicaid/apple care, there are some private practice therapists who accept this form of insurance, as well as community clinics which do. if you are not insured, some therapists and clinics will work on a sliding fee scale, and accept either low fee or may even work with you pro-bono (for free).<br></p>"

"i love him so much, and i don't know what to do.","<p>hi savannah, this is a pretty common issue; one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving, yet their partner doesn't feel loved. there's a great book ""the five love languages"" by gary chapman. he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love, but we don't necessarily all speak the same ""love language"" as our partner. you might feel that by going out to work and earn money, you're being loving, but if your partner's main love language is quality time, you're not hitting that bulls eye because you're not home! the five languages are words, quality time, acts of service, gifts and touch. i recommend couples grab this book, sit down and figure out what their love languages are, and then...slowly...you start to ask for the kind of love you want, and you start to speak your partner's language a bit better. you may never be fluent, but you can get better. the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that there's nothing wrong with either of you, you're just speaking different languages. you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved. i bet he just needs you to ""speak his language"". &nbsp;:)</p>"

what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?,"<p>i will admit i am confused about this question.  are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist? </p><p>therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication.  most therapists won't even get involved in a custody battle.  they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court.  of course, therapists are human and can make mistakes, but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation.  not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this, they are going to face criminal charges and jail time.  if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child, they don't have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this. </p><p>if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board.  every therapist is licensed in their state.  there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapist's licensure.</p><p>most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly.  don't accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad.  have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this.  if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported, but don't try to ruin someone's career unless you are sure this occurred.</p>"

"i've only been married three months. every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.","<p>one key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. when couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>i'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? if you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">when things are good between you</span> - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. that way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.&nbsp;</p>"
does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"<p>counseling allows us to have a sacred space, a space that is set apart from the outside world, it is a space of non-judgement and exploration. being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times, this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves. it allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes, our behaviors and our feelings. imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank, although i dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks, i would imagine he does not see the world outside of him, he only sees the small fishbowl, oblivious to the outside world, when one comes into the counseling room, one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there. remember the observer affect, one cannot truly act objectively with the world, we are in a dynamic relationship with life, it reacts to us and we to it, the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits, allowing us to see what was before hidden, often times in plain sight.<br></p>"

in our culture tobacco can be healthy. it helps cope with stress and is so much better than alcohol.,"tobacco feels like a healthier choice than some of the other things you could turn to to cope. finding a way to cope with stress is important to you. you've considered some other coping mechanisms but for right now you're using tobacco. you use tobacco to cope with stress. you clearly haven't found something to help you cope. you need to find a healthy way to decompress like journaling, reading, exercising, or crafting. alcohol is no better than smoking.  do you know all of the risks of smoking? but there are negative effects, running and releasing the endorphins in the body brings you happiness, relaxes and is also good for your mental and physical health. even with culture we most remember moderation in order to thrive in life. all indicators are that tobacco use is not healthy but if you want to in moderation it's probably not as bad as some other things. my dad died of cancer at a young age and never smoked in his life. my brother died of cancer at a young age and smoked his whole life. i say it makes little if any difference so do whatever you want to."

my partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process. it’s especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him. i feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me.,"<p>hold on, sanger! you know, i meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes, they wonder if it's best to go back. i don't think so.</p><p>if your ex is using the children to manipulate, or is generally controlling the separation process, that's confirmation that getting out was the right decision.</p><p>your partner feels powerless to change the current situation. of course he does, because there are many things that are beyond his control (his ex's behaviours, for one). accept the powerlessness. lean into it. it's okay, because there are many things he does have power over, and that's where he can focus.&nbsp;</p><p>he has the power to give his children a happy dad. that's huge. that's why he left, i'd guess. i bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. that's his ex's voice...that's what she wants him to feel...to give into that is letting her win. ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right. he has not intentionally harmed his children. hopefully he's aware that the separation has &nbsp;affected them and he's working to create peace and balance in their lives, but he's can let go of the shame she wants him to feel; it's crippling him.</p><p>he has the power to separate emotionally from his ex. he's not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions. he's still reacting to her. he hasn't completely left yet.</p><p>a good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions, combat shame, create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries. he needs your support in moving forwards, not going backwards. i wish you the best.&nbsp;</p>"
"my husband doesn’t trust me for some past we had. i know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that i am messing around, which i am not.","<p>hi louisiana,</p><p>it's normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time. his reactions may not mean that he doesn't trust you, but rather that he gets scared that he's going to be hurt again.&nbsp;</p><p>you're a bit vague about the past. you don't say whether you cheated or not. if you did, then you might try taking an approach where you a) take responsibility for your past actions, b) show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that, c) do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority, and d) reassure him when he says he's scared or feeling insecure. i'm suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that you're so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear. this is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury.</p><p>part of the issue might be that when he brings it up, he's coming across as angry, accusing or suspicious, rather than scared and insecure. this often happens. a therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger, and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger (which is also natural, but less helpful in those moments), and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him.&nbsp;</p><p>as much as you want to forget about it, he might need to talk about it sometimes, and that's normal. his needs are important. also important, however, is your need for respect. if he approaches it in a disrespectful way, that's a separate problem. if it's brought up as a weapon, used to shut you down, or used to control or punish, those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts. you can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the past.</p><p>a qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory. best of luck.</p>"
my wife just last week said she wants a divorce and it's all sudden. i understand that marriages have their ups and downs but i don't understand why she can't tell me why she wants a divorce. should i fight for my family (daughter and wife)?,"<p>chances are, if you really think about it, there were signs that something wasn’t quite right in your marriage. you may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage, but whatever it was (or wasn't), it's obviously bothering your wife. i would say yes, keep trying to fight for your family, at least until you know what the problems are from your wife's perspective and if they're repairable. ask your wife if she’s willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor. just be sure you’re open to hearing what's said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some things.</p><p>even if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce, that doesn't mean you’re divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that. continue to be a part of her life. and although it may be difficult, if a divorce does happen, try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isn't further impacted by this new family dynamic.</p>"

"if i try to quit drinking, i’ll have to go live on an island by myself for a month or so.  and i can’t do that, i have a family.  my kids need me.  and it’s not fair to them that i take out my anger on them.  and usually when i try to quit, my husband will hand me a drink after a couple hours and beg me to have some so i shut up.","your drinking is causing conflict in your family. you're at a place where you know it'd be best for your family if you were to quit, but you're not sure how to make that happen without leaving to detox.  you haven't been successful giving up alcohol in the past. your husband has been known to jepordize your plans when you star to get cranky. if there was a way to sit down with him and come up with a plan together for this attempt at quitting for good, things could potentially turn out a bit different.  you don't know how you're going to be able to quit drinking. you need to manage your anger with something that's not alcohol if you want to quit sucessfully. have you tried reading an anger management book? you need to go to someone who is competent that can really help you and your family, but you are really brave to share your thinks. don't live that kind of life anymore, don't accept it, value your life and especially the lives of your children. you're right to think about your family and the impact you can have on their wellbeing, so let's look more deeply into why you feel you need the drink."

"my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?","<p>hi winters, i learned a long time ago that i can't ever predict who will change and who won't. i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but can't make it work, and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change. but in reading your story, the image of a slot machine came to mind. you're gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change. only you can decide how many years to give it. i see him giving you clear signs that he doesn't even believe in himself or want to change though. what are you waiting for?</p><p>although you say you know his behaviours aren't your fault, something tells me that you're hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change. it doesn't work that way. just like the slot machine, you have no power to change him or make this work. you can only decide when you've paid too much.&nbsp;</p><p>i bet there's someone out there who loves and misses you. he's not your only support.&nbsp;</p>"

"i have a hard time checking my blood sugar, so busy with the kids and work, kept thinking about that time i checked my sugar and ended up giving myself too much insulin, don’t want end up like my mom.","it’s hard to find a middle ground between checking your blood sugar often enough and giving yourself the right amount of insulin. you’re worried that if you don’t figure it out soon there might be some negative consequences. it's a struggle to check your blood sugar reguarly. you'll get sick if you don't have enough insulin. this is something you have to do for yourself. no one else can help you. are you avoiding being like mom by not checking your insulin? so start taking regular exams and if you want to live well and take care of your children, value and take care of your health. that sounds like a hectic life! setting a daily alarm could help. you could set an alarm on your phone. you could also download an app specifically for managing blood sugar. i can help you find one. you need to make time to do these things for yourself"

"often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and i can't get it out.  how can i stop these thoughts?","<p>scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. i want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. i also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. so, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen, he wrote the book buddha's brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. there are reasons that our brain works this way, but i don't have time to go into all of that in this response. so, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, &nbsp;this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.&nbsp;</p>"

i'm a 40 year old male and having erection problems. still have the desire for a woman. awfully frustrated. any suggestions? my doc doesn't want to discuss it.,<p>when a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one! ed can often be caused by health issues. if all physical possibilities are ruled out then it's time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist. here's a good <a href='https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/save-your-sex-life/201011/healing-erectile-dysfunction' target='_blank'>article for you to start with</a>.</p>
"she’s only 16, i don’t know why she needs to know she has turner syndrome. she’s only going to get upset.",you have your child’s best interest at heart and right now you’re thinking it would be best for her if you didn’t share this information. it's scary to think about telling her. not only will she potentially respond negatively but it also makes it more real by talking about it with her. you think 16 is not old enough to worry about turner syndrome. she will be more upset if she has turner syndrome and we leave it untreated. she is old enough to understand. are you just scared to tell her? tell her and it starts to understand from a young age. i think she shoud know because she is going to find out one day. nothing is confirmed. let us pray she should be safe and out of it.
i don't know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger. that's really the only one i feel.,"<p>well, then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you have!</p><p>what is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings? &nbsp;your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feel.</p><p>sometimes the family in which someone grew up, did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they were.</p><p>in some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind. &nbsp;by knowing where your difficulties started, you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelings.</p><p>also, spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are. &nbsp;</p><p>often, people who have difficulty in expressing themselves, suffered shame and humiliation as a child. &nbsp;they have a chronic sense of worthlessness, and feeling worthless certainly works against self-expression. &nbsp;by having a good time being with yourself, you may increase your self-appreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating.</p>"
"my suppose-to-be father told me to go find my real dad. we haven't been getting along since i was a teenager. if i said one thing that he thought was wrong, i always got degraded. he never said “i love you.” he never gave us hugs. he’s always called me horrible names. i feel he's an evil man with no feelings.","<p>hi louisiana, you got it right...he's ""supposed to be"" your father. it's tough enough being adopted (unless i'm reading it wrong, i think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. i don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but i bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. it's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. that's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. it's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). i think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. i don't know if he's evil (although i believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.&nbsp;</p><p>a good therapist can support you in these goals. i wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult. :)</p>"
i switched from smoking tobacco to chewing it because it is better for you.,"you like the idea of making decisions based on what’s best for your health. since chewing tobacco is better for you, it makes more sense than smoking.  you've put some thought into your behaviors and how they impact your health. you switched to chewing for your health. no. smoking tobacco is no better for you. do you know the risks of chewing? it is not better for you exactly. you could end up with mouth cancer. im sure that there are risks will checking tabacco also. maybe you should try a gum or lozenge instead. they are both bad for you so maybe you could quit the chew as well."
"i'm in a relationship with my fiancé and i currently found out that she's been cheating on me with a co-worker. i was very upset none the less. i understand what she did was wrong, but i want to spend the rest of my life with her. so i'm willing to forgive and move on. we have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. at the beginning of our relationship, i was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. she forgave me for what i've done to her and since then i been completely faithful. i'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward  but its been very unsettling. all i can think about is her with another man. i don't know what to do or where to go for advice?","<p>my first question for you would be to see if you've talked with her about it yet? you mentioned you found out....and i know this can be so painful. it can also be frightening to bring up the experience when it hurts a lot, when you feel so unsettled as you mention. but you can look at this as a vital and important piece of information about what's happening in your relationship, and an invitation to get really honest and genuine with each other.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">you have a long history, being together 9 years, and a son, so you are very bonded no matter what changes happen in your relationship. it may be incredibly helpful to find a counselor you can both go talk with. having a third party who is neutral and cares about your process and hers can be such a relief when you need to discuss things you feel scared about. even just a few sessions can make a huge difference.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">if this doesn't feel possible for you right now.....ask your fiancee for time to set aside for a meaningful heart-to-heart talk. say you'd like to set it up on the calendar, and make sure you have a babysitter for your son. set aside at least 4 hours. let her know that you'd like to hear her honest truth about what's going on, and share with her your truth as well. it's not a time for criticizing or condemning, and i don't sense that is your intention at all--you have a great deal of love for her. speaking honestly and listening openly is an amazing gift, both for yourself and for your partner. you can do it.</span><br></p>"
"i am a teenage girl. i've been seeing the same dream once in a while since i was very young. the problem is that i don't remember anything about this dream. i still know that it's the same one, and then i wake up in a panic, and i cry really loud without knowing the reason. why do i see the same dream, why can i not remember it, and what should i do to remember it?","there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that i know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. one thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.<br><p><br></p>"
"my toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training. he almost throws up every time he sees his poop. he gags and will not go on the toilet. we have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the big-boy toilet, but he refuses to use it. when he sits on the toilet, he just sits there forever and only will pee. he holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. i dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. how can i help him get over this fear and passed the stress?","<p>your son is showing signs that he's just not ready to be toilet trained. you don't say how old he is, so i'm not sure whether the problem is deeper, but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step. pushing him at this point could worsen the problem, so i suggest pulling back the expectations, waiting a month or two, looking for more signs of readiness and trying again. in general, teaching children to use the toilet works best when ""mistakes"" are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively.&nbsp;</p>"
"i started seeing this guy that i met at a mutual friend’s place. he recently broke up with his ex-girlfriend and started seeing me. everything was great in the beginning, then i started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his ex-girlfriend again. it’s all i think about. i am still seeing him, but things have changed because i am at a loss for words. i get stuck in my own thoughts. i like and care for him a lot. he just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies.","<p>sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts. &nbsp;as you stated, everything was great then you started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking. &nbsp;what is contributing to these negative thoughts? &nbsp;his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question..</p>"
"i found the guy i’m dating on dating websites. he was telling women that they were beautiful. he said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. it has since happened two other times. he says he loves me and i’m the only girl he wants to be with, but i feel he is not telling me the truth.","<p>i would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. for example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. you could also see what your boyfriend wants.</p><p>you may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. after that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.</p><p>remember that it takes two people to have &nbsp;a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.</p>"
"i've been with him for a couple months. we will talk everyday and he will get mad over something i will say and not talk to me. we have our great moments, but i just need to focus on my personal situations, and i feel he is slowing me down with that. i still wanna be with him, but not now.","<p>why don't you just tell him everything that you just wrote here?</p><p>you're clear in your mind as to what you would like.</p><p>unless you have a whole either side to the way you feel, everything you wrote here explains your position very well.</p><p>good luck in having your conversation!</p>"
"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  now he is depressed and hopeless again.","<p>the fact that you're reaching out for help here is really helpful.</p><p>the first thing i would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details, how this is affecting you, and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband.</p><p>from the way that you describe this, i wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital. perhaps you can have a conversation with your husband this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about his experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital, and now things are not as good. perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him.</p><p>i also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment.</p><p>there may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again. there are national crisis telephone numbers listed below as well.</p>"
i'm going through a majorly bad divorce and my wife is making things so impossible for me. i need help.,"<p>crying due to a dissolution of a marriage, is normal. &nbsp;</p><p>hating yourself may be a sign of extreme sadness, feelings of loss and uncertainty.</p><p>do you know why you hate yourself?&nbsp;</p><p>discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible, to move from ""hate"" to ""self-love"".</p><p>divorce signals a loss of familiar life structure and daily routines. &nbsp; as with any meaningful loss, crying is part of mourning what is soon to be gone.</p><p>if you have confidence in your attorney's handling of the legal areas related to the divorce, and the ""impossible"" you reference is on facing and coming to terms with statements and behaviors from your wife that you never noticed before, then your best choice is to find a therapist whom you feel at ease in talking with, to sort through the emotional upheaval within yourself and your everyday life and world.</p><p>divorce is a wonderful time for learning about ones own emotional needs and expectations in relationships since these are the areas currently coming apart.</p><p>the good news behind losing something that seems valuable, is that new space becomes open to attract what is more suitable for who you are.</p><p><br></p>"
"i'm depressed. i have been for years. i hide it from everyone because i'm scared of the reactions i'll get. last time i tried telling my parents, it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed (i’m a legal adult), calling me ungrateful, and telling me that if i can't handle things now, it's only going to get worse in the future (which is turning out to be true). it's exhausting pretending to be okay, and i don't know how much longer i can try. i'm just really tired, and sadly, i can't afford the help i need on my own.","<p>don't think that you can't afford the help you need on your own.&nbsp; there are several counselors that see people on a sliding scale that can be as low as $5 (based on your income).&nbsp; find a center that is non-profit, they have great counselors as well.&nbsp;</p><p>it sounds like you know what you are experiencing and know that you need someone to talk to, someone&nbsp;that is willing to listen.&nbsp; your parents&nbsp;may not&nbsp;understand what your are feeling right now and that is not totally abnormal.</p><p>i would encourage you to seek help immediately so you can live the best live you can...which is not being depressed.&nbsp; <br></p>"
"i’d always had a lot of energy, but now with this heart failure thing i can’t do anything. i tried to go christmas shopping, but by the time i’d gone about a block, i was so tired that my husband took me home and i went back to bed.","chf has taken away your energy and your freedom. it has gotten in the way of getting your stuff done, and that has gotten you down. you're starting to realize just how much of an impact having chf is going to have on the rest of your life. if there was a way you could still get out and about without feeling so tired, you might be willing to give it a try. you energy level now is too low for the things you want to get done. you need to reduce your expectations for what you can accomplish. could you think of anything to cut from your schedule? patience we are not always strong, but just start things will change. you need to adapt to this problem, understand that at the moment you can't do things the way you used to. try to find a place where you can buy everything in one place, make a list and research first and go straight without changing the route. im sorry to hear that you are finding things so difficult"
i find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. how do i figure out what triggers me to do this? and how do i help overcome this problem? i would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.,"<p>well let's start with the awesome realization you've already had, you want to notice that you have triggers. that's huge. really. </p><p>i find that when people lie, it's most often as a defense mechanism. which is likely a flag that something doesn't feel safe. what exactly doesn't feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that it's that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you. </p><p>it could really help to explore this with therapist, perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty -- that's not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers! </p>"
"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and i just had my first kiss five months ago. i’m worried that, at this rate, i won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, i don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. i feel dirty by doing this, but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking. i am tall, i play lots of sports, and i get excellent grades in school. i am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. it bothers me. most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. i feel like i will be single forever sometimes.","<p>i think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is, ""what's the rush?"" &nbsp;just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there's something wrong or something to be ashamed of. &nbsp;if anything, i want to commend you on the self-respect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it. &nbsp;<br><br>one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others; while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you - they don't see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective. it's important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals. &nbsp;once you stop comparing your happiness, you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down.&nbsp;</p>"
"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. he recently got a new job and travels a lot. i’m not used to him being gone all the time. i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.
i feel lost, sad and unwanted. this is really a tough new challenge. i just want to break up with him, but i love him so much. i don’t know why he is acting this way lately. i believe i have separation anxiety. is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?","<p>consider talking with your boyfriend about times that you may be able to talk together while he is away. this way, you have an idea when you'll be able to contact him. does he recognize the feelings that you have while he is away? how do you feel when you are together with him and he is home?</p><p>i'm also curious as to how the level of your anxiety (on a scale of 1 to 10, perhaps) changes during the parts of his trips. maybe there are certain parts that are more or less related to anxiety for you. perhaps you have less anxiety while working or involved in a specific activity, for example, spending time with friends.</p><p>when you are both in the same area (when your boyfriend is not traveling), do you do some things independently with friends?&nbsp;</p><p>do you know what leads to your anxiety when he is away? i don't know whether it is a general feeling of wanting him to come back or anxiety that something specific will happen to you or him.</p><p>do you ever recall feeling this way in your past? if so, what was happening then?</p><p>what do you have that makes you feel very safe and comfortable?</p><p>consider working with a mental health professional in the area. perhaps it would be helpful for the two of you to meet with a therapist who specializes in couples to see what kind of relationship you want to have and what you can each do to contribute to that relationship. there could be things that you could both start or stop doing to help your relationship move in the direction where you would like it to go. as an example, perhaps you would like a text before your boyfriend goes to bed, no matter what time zone or time of day it is. perhaps he would prefer a good morning text or call/voicemail from you.</p>"
"i've always thought that there wasn't much good out there for me. now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone. i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and i don't know how to process this. it's bothering both of us.","<p>hi! thank you for your question. it's tough to be in a healthy and loving relationship when we believe we are not worth it. quite often being in such a relationship is very uncomfortable as it goes against everything we believe about ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>first, i want to say you are very brave to open up yourself to the relationship with this wonderful woman you met.&nbsp;</p><p>second, i would like to invite you to treat yourself with compassion as you are entering this unknown territory for yourself. doing something new and totally unfamiliar can be scary, so it's vital that you are kind and gentle with yourself. acknowledge that what you are doing is scary and uncomfortable and that it will take some time to get used to it.&nbsp;</p><p>don't judge yourself and force yourself to feel a certain way. it's important that you are patient with yourself and tolerant of your discomfort. with time, space, kindness, and tolerance your discomfort and fear will start to dissolve. invite your new partner to also relate to your feelings in the open and compassionate way.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>the worst thing that you or your partner can do is to rush your feelings, pressure you to feel in a different way or to say that there is something wrong with you cause you feel a certain way. please be gentle with yourself and celebrate and acknowledge every small victory. every time you do something little, like holding hands or receive a compliment and it no longer scares you as it did a week ago - celebrate that progress!&nbsp;</p>"
"i get so much anxiety, and i don’t know why. i feel like i can’t do anything by myself because i’m scared of the outcomes.","<p>the other two post answers to your question are very good and i don't feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well, but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks. &nbsp;chain

does counseling really do anything that can help people?,<p>counseling provides a safe environment for people to explore the beliefs about the challenges in life. the various types(modalities/techniques) of counseling serve as guides for specific individual's personal journeys.<br></p>
"i was a victim of an incident. i've been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because i don't feel anyone honestly believes me. there are so many other factors i deal with on a daily basis. i ignore my problems when i'm with my friends, but it’s scary when i’m alone.","<p>&nbsp; as you seemed to have learned, the impact will not just ""go away"". treatment of trauma is like surgery, it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it. while you are contemplating getting help, you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga. they will aid you when you begin the therapeutic process.</p>"
"i was the one who ended it, and i'm so glad i did. it was the best decision i made in my life. but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks? it is creating a wall in my current relationship.",it sounds like you have not had the opportunity to process through the trauma you have endured. it would help if you have the opportunity to speak with someone on a regular basis until the symptoms of your trauma have subsided.<p></p>

we’ve already had so many tests done to figure out why jonnie has his problems. i’m not sure if doing this new test (whole genome sequencing) is just another waste of time and money.,you’re questioning if putting jonnie through these new tests is really necessary. you're torn about whether or not these tests are going to be worth the time and money. johnnie has received a lot of tests but none tell you what problem he has. whole genome sequencing will provide answers we don't have yet. doesn't a parent do everything they possibly can for their child? it'll bring you peace of mind if you finally figured out what was causing the problems. the new test would be helpful regardless. there's always hope in getting a new test done. i think you should give it a go. eventually you're gonna get a test that works but you won't find it unless you keep trying. it is never a waste of money when it comes to a person's health.

"he isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. he's working on them and has improved. we started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","<p>hello and thank you for your question. i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive. being involved in a relationship with a partner&nbsp;who does the behaviors&nbsp;you describe can be incredibly difficult, and many would argue is even harder than&nbsp;overcoming actual physical violence. </p><p>i was a little confused about whether you're are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it. i am going to assume you are still undecided. </p><p><br></p><p>some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse. even without physical abuse, being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing. when partners question and accuse, they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations.&nbsp; the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty&nbsp;and to manipulate them. for example, if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends, you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring. </p><p>the person being accused or questioned often tries&nbsp;to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong, but it doesn't matter. </p><p>and that brings me to the point of what some people&nbsp;who experience these behaviors&nbsp;do in order to start feeling like they have some power again.&nbsp;here are just a few things:</p><p><br></p><p>1. they realize there is no right answer. trying to be logical with someone who doesn't want to be logical doesn't work. many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway.&nbsp;in addition, the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis, and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next. and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;the find support. finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea. one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things&nbsp;is begin to have a negative&nbsp;concept of ourselves. surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person&nbsp;is a great idea. </p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;they reinvest in themselves. try to find some time for yourself. this couldn't possibly sound more cliché, but it is actually true. whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one. one thing that can happen when emotional abuse&nbsp;takes place in a relationship&nbsp;is the person&nbsp;being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life. taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspective.</p><p>i don't know if you are still in counseling, but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great. if not, there are others you can try. it's important to find the right fit. </p><p><br></p><p>as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner, that is a question that can only be answered by you. but you could ask yourself some questions&nbsp; like these to help you decide:</p><p><br></p><p>1. what are some of my values about relationships? do&nbsp;i&nbsp;want trust? honesty? ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship.</p><p>2. do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me, or does it seem to bring me down?</p><p>3. if i want to stay in this relationship, what are some specific things that need to change? </p><p><br></p><p>hope some of these suggestions help. </p><p><br></p><p>good luck to you. be well.</p><p><br></p><p>robin landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

"after first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","<p>after meeting a client, many counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for. this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis, which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor. if you are paying out of pocket, this diagnosis is not really required for payment, but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us. the better we understand what it is that bothers you, what you would like to get out of the counseling, and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues, the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals. how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling, and that information is too much for this little post.</p>"
"sometimes i can't stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.

am i crazy? i don't think these thoughts are normal.","<p>hi california, what you're experiencing is indeed anxiety; it's very common. through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. i'll get you started and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.</p><p>it's natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. our brains are complex, wonderful things. fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture; their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it. but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily. we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen. when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life, it becomes a problem. so, while fear and anxiety try to protect us, they also seek power and will take any power they can get.</p><p>in general, fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things: that something is wrong with us, or that something bad will happen (or that something bad will happen because there's something wrong with us). they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you. for example... ""that person looked at you funny. you're strange looking"". well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person's face, and it's unlikely it had anything to do with you.&nbsp;</p><p>for you personally, your thoughts are about the afterlife...about living forever. what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? what would the worst part be? a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. it might be that you have no <span style=""font-style: italic;"">control </span>over who you are or where you go. it might be that you fear going to hell because you're ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">bad</span>"". search for that deepest fear.</p><p>i invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. it's a heavy glass, and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it, it would get in the way; you'd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. that's what's happening now. i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you're having; we all have random silly thoughts that usually aren't true. the problem is how long you're holding it in your hand. you could have that thought (pick up that glass) a hundred times a day and, as long as you put it right back on the shelf, it's not a problem. the trick is to get it back on that shelf.</p><p>right now, you're using distraction to do this. you're trying to focus on other things around you, but i think the glass is still in your hand. it's not enough; you're looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf. &nbsp;and the key is in your thoughts. once you find out what fear is trying to tell you, then you can ""talk back to"" fear. so, as an example, if fear is saying to you ""you have no control over anything"", then you can work to accept the pieces you don't have control over, learn to tolerate that feeling, and claim back the pieces you can control. you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over.&nbsp;</p><p>with a therapist you can learn to ""refute"" fears' ideas. you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear's lies and gain back control over your thoughts. i wish you the best!</p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist. even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress, the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit. and the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not. it is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate.</p>"

"me and my girlfriend just broke up. she said she loves me but is not in love anymore. this came out of nowhere. we seemed so happy together.
it all started when she went to missouri to visit her family. the first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. that's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. i thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.
then she told me to come to her in missouri. so that's what i did. i quit my job i dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.
once i got there everything was fine again.  she apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me.
the only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. this wasn’t an accident. we were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. i love her so much. i have never been bad to her. i've treated her the best i can. i wanted her to be my wife. i was going to propose to her when she got back. now i'm losing my family and my mind. i don't know what to do.","<p>i am sorry to hear of these troubles.  i see a few issues here.  i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled?  some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.</p><p>you say you never treated her badly, and i believe you.  people in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on.  in fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy.  it takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship.  expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.</p><p>there are two books that i recommend you buy and read.  one is codependent no more.  the other is can my relationship be saved?</p><p>sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable.  you cannot change her and cannot change her mind.  sometimes the best thing is to let go.  if it is meant to be, you will end up back together again.  it seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving.  i suggest backing off and letting her go.  maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind.  if it is meant to be, she will come back. if not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own.</p>"

however, it’s intensified lately. i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. what can i do?","<p>what you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. you have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>this is often seen in families. it's seen everywhere. how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? it is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. for example, i bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>i'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. that's what therapists do every day! sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. however, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>if you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. i heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. if your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. from your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. if you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. i am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. </p><p>regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. they will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. in worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>"

i’ll probably drink less when i am older but for now i am going to party.,"down the line you might want to consider changing how much you drink, but at this stage of your life it doesn't feel necessary to make any changes.  at some point you may start to think that the amount you drink is too much. you don't think you drink too much. you'll be older before you know it and by then will have some serious negative health consequences unless you reduce or eliminate your drinking now. you're building habits that will be harder to break, the longer you have them.  at what age is older? have you thought about possible long term repercussions from drinking too much? it can damage your liver and make you more susceptible to cancer. it’s fine the party, but you need to be able to be in control of these partying times. it just takes one mistake to ruin everything for the rest of your life. don't think so, it destroys you inside without you realizing it."

i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,"<p>would you describe yourself as sensitive to your surroundings and emotions?</p><p>if yes, this may explain why letting go of past problems, is itself a problem.</p><p>the dynamic of living one day at a time and letting go of past problems, is more imaginary and wishful than real.</p><p>it is a popular notion of tv, fb, and media.</p><p>doing the letting go, has nothing to do with what is actually possible to do.</p><p>problems are not ""let go"", they are resolved somehow.</p><p>living one day at a time isn't possible for anyone who has consciousness. &nbsp;no one can really disconnect from reality every day on which they wake up.</p><p>instead of trying to do the impossible which is promoted online and in media, allow yourself time to recognize what went into creating a problem in your life, in the first place. &nbsp;</p><p>understanding problems leads to peacefulness and resolution. &nbsp;then you will have more freedom to make new relationships.</p><p>also, be patient with this process and yourself.</p><p>if you have deep attachment to painful situations in your life, then possibly now is your time for understanding what went wrong.</p><p>this is a process which cannot be rushed if it is to be done well.</p><p>if it is done thoroughly, then you very naturally will bring new relationships into your life.</p><p>and life will no longer feel so painful that you can only manage ""one day at a time"" without hurting. &nbsp;you won't need to forget what happened yesterday.&nbsp;</p>"

"i was the one who ended it, and i'm so glad i did. it was the best decision i made in my life. but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks? it is creating a wall in my current relationship.","<p>one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now. if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice, that may help to center you. tried to stay grounded and/or mindful. that is being aware of your position in the room, your feet on the floor, your hands in your lap, or your hips in the chair. being mindful of the environment you are currently (for example, noticing what is around you) may be helpful. try to use all your senses. for example, you could focus on hearing your husband's voice, feeling his hand in yours, being wrapped in your favorite blanket, seeing a comforting photo, using a comforting sense or candle, or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchen.</p><p>it also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma. i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professional.</p><p>remember, just because it was the best decision of your life, that doesn't mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship. our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again. this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all.</p>"

i know i should probably get the vaccine. i have my mother living with me and she has type-2 diabetes. i would hate to bring it home to her. but i just don’t know about those side effects. i heard it changes your dna and the vaccine can give you the virus.,"while you have some concerns about the vaccine, part of you feels it would  protect your mother and you don’t want to be responsible for her getting sick.  sounds like finding answers to your questions about the safety of the vaccine might help you decide.     you want to protect your mom, but you're worried about the side effects of being vaccinated. you don't want to give your mom covid. you need to protect your mother and get over your worries. the thing is safe. you cannot get the virus from the vaccine, and it cannot change your dna. mrna vaccines don’t work like that.    do you believe the side effects of the vaccine are worse for you than if you got covid-19? follow what experts say, not what you hear from others. i know it can sound intimidating but consider what's important to you and make a decision based on that. stop listening to bad advice and get the facts. the vaccine is innate, it cannot give you the virus or make it so you are positive and spread it to others. that does not mean you can't get the virus even when vaccinated a lot of people have."

are they right, am i depressed?","<p>although some people managing depression feel sad or ""down"", &nbsp;it&nbsp;is a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood. &nbsp;many people indicate that they feel numb or flat. &nbsp;people managing depression often have low motivation.&nbsp;they may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities. &nbsp;people with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame. &nbsp; if you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks, i recommend that you see a counselor to get a more in-depth&nbsp;evaluation. &nbsp; the symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression, and with a bit of support, you could regain energy and improved self-esteem. &nbsp;the stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a label&nbsp;of depression seem scary. &nbsp;the important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders. &nbsp; &nbsp;hang in there. &nbsp;healing is possible!&nbsp;</p>"

"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. he recently got a new job and travels a lot. i’m not used to him being gone all the time. i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.
i feel lost, sad and unwanted. this is really a tough new challenge. i just want to break up with him, but i love him so much. i don’t know why he is acting this way lately. i believe i have separation anxiety. is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?","<p>in a way, yes, you have separation anxiety. it's normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection. so, just because your boyfriend isn't talking as much or keeping you up-to-date doesn't necessarily mean what you fear it means...that he's forgotten about you or loves you less. it could mean quite the opposite...that he's focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you. he may think he's loving you more, but you feel loved less. you have two jobs to do here. the first is to manage your anxiety by ""talking back"" to the thoughts it puts into your head. it sounds like ""it's normal to be insecure, but i have tons of evidence that he loves me and that i mean the world to him..."" find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim. the second part of your job is to let him know what you need. you need more affection and connection during this period when he's away (more texts, phone calls, information). it's okay to want that, and i am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when he's away.&nbsp;<br></p>"
i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. how can i fix my underlying issues?,"<p>hi there. it's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. at the root of it is fear. fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. all those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. the thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. vicious circle, right? </p><p>what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. you can start with this assignment. write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. for example, thinking something like, &#34;i'm too pushy&#34;, can be rewritten as, &#34;i'm assertive and i go after what i want.&#34; it can be hard to do since we tend to get &#34;stuck&#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. if you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.</p><p>finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. you've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.</p>"

"we weren't long distance until he joined the military.  i love him and i know he loves, me but it's complicated. he said he's not going to find someone else, but i'm afraid. how do i keep our relationship going?","<p>you're right that long-distance relationships can be complicated. if he loves you and you love him, that's a great start. i wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved, valued, special, and appreciated.</p><p>when having important discussions, consider the following:</p><ul><li>make sure it is a good time to have a discussion (and if you're doing it in writing because of the distance, you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesn't have 10 minutes or something like that)</li><li>try to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other. asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversations.</li><li>when having discussions face-to-face, i often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them. as for how that translates to distance, maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the internet (or, if possible, use some kind of timeframe).</li></ul><p>consider what questions you would like answers to. for example, are you wondering:</p><ul><li>what should i do if i miss you or want to talk to you more? i don't want to make you feel guilty, but i also don't want to hide my feelings. can i share them with you?</li><li>if you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly, can i keep sending you messages or is that overwhelming?</li><li>how will you ask for support from me?</li><li>some couples really want to protect each other. in doing so, instead of hiding our emotions, can we share them and work through them together?</li><li>whatever else comes to mind.</li></ul><p>gary chapman is famous for his books about the 5 love languages. he has one specifically for military families:&nbsp;the 5 love languages military edition: the secret to love that lasts.</p><p>here's a list of books related to loving from a distance:&nbsp;http://www.longdistancerelationships.net/bookstor.htm</p><p>i have not read these books myself, but i have read other works by a lot of the authors.</p><p>one final tip: consider making a list of times when you work together and both feeling calm, safe, and comfortable. these memories could be helpful to you during difficult moments.</p><p>best wishes to you. remember that you could each see therapists in your respective locations if that would be helpful to you.</p>"

"i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","<div>since it is clear that people react differently to the same&nbsp;stressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, <b>our thoughts</b> about the stressors are. often, cognitive distortions are the problem. some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind-reading (i just know he is angry at me) and can't-standitis (i can't stand this situation). there are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, i would advise looking up cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local cbt therapist. </div><div><br></div><div>another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called ""symptom stress"" - being anxious about anxiety. if we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, ""oh no i'm getting nervous about this, i'm getting uptight, i look nervous, what if i have a panic attack!"" followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;more cognitive distortions such as ""i can't stand being anxious!"" and ""this is horrible!""&nbsp;the&nbsp;antidote to this is acceptance.&nbsp; kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (jon kabat-zinn). if you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself - this is just a reaction i'm having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. i can tolerate and survive some anxiety, i can breathe deeply,&nbsp;and i'll be ok because panic attacks never killed anyone. i can stand this and it is temporary. you get the idea.</div><div><br></div><div>we can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. we have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. we brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, "" we learn what we&nbsp;believe when we hear ourselves speak,"" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)<br></div>"

"a few years ago i was making love to my wife when for no known reason i lost my erection, 

now i'm in my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent.  this is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. this has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. 

i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. i am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like i used to. 

what could be causing this, and what can i do about it?","<p>for starters, know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives. while this can certainly cause some embarrassment, a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems, it is important to know you are not alone. i am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this. assuming that is the case, for most this happens for two primary reasons. it is either a short term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis. this can be caused my diet, lack of exercise, even stress. another primary reason for loss of erections are anxiety. have their been recent relationship issues? are you feeling as though you aren't satisfied in the bedroom? these are just a few aspects that can cause subconscious anxiety and loss of erection. my suggestion to you would be to seek out a counselor that specializes in sexuality that can assist you in moving forward with this.&nbsp; best of luck!<br></p>"

"my ex-boyfriend boyfriend and i lived together. he had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. one was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. they are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. he has nothing to offer me.","<p>hi attica,</p><p>this is a question i think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can't forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn't good for them.&nbsp;</p><p>in your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. for some people, honestly, it's a game... to see how much power they have over you or it's their need to control you. if you don't want contact from this person, it's really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (""don't contact me again""), and then ignore all of their communications. any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. i hear you doing that already when you say ""he has nothing to offer me"". that's great self-talk.</p><p>but let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. sometimes it's because we still hope they will change. maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those ""good old days"". the problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. so what they're eventually showing you is who they are and what they're capable of. people do change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.&nbsp;</p><p>another reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. this is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. it's as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. you deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn't demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.&nbsp;</p><p>it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. if you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. it will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.</p><p>draw a line. their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

how can i approach them about it? should i hold back and keep it a secret, or should i just be up-front about it.  i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  what should i do?","<p>thanks for asking this question. i think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. for that reason, i would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.</p><p>as far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, i don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. in other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. the answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. i would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this.&nbsp;</p><p>it sounds like this is an important part of you, so i would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.</p><p>i also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.</p><p>i'd also ask you to consider this: are the people who you say this to expecting it? my guess is that the answer is probably not. along with that, are they going to have questions? i would imagine so.</p><p>are you comfortable answering questions?</p><p>i wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:</p><ul><li>what exactly is cross-dressing?</li><li>does that change the gender that you're attracted to?</li><li>what does it mean to you?</li><li>why is it important to you?</li><li>and what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.</li></ul><p>there could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.</p><p>i certainly hope that you find the right person for you. i imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.</p>"
"i’m trying to make marriage work after a split. before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. i don't think he cheated. last month, i asked what women work with him, so he told me. yesterday, i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. should i be upset?",<p>in response to your answer. yes because he broke a boundary of yours that he knew was important to you. the question that should be asked is are you able to go forward with your husband with his behaviors not changing for the better in regards to your feelings and emotions?</p>

"about two and a half months ago, i met a woman on a dating site. we went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date. we respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. after that, i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. then one day, she went to her family’s house on thanksgiving and everything changed. within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. we had finally found each other. we told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. a few days after thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. i was very hurt and didn’t understand. then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. i was crushed!

a few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. so for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. she had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. she doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. i know she needs time, and all i can do is take care of myself. we have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn’t work out for her, we will try again. i’m completely in love with her, and i’m in extreme pain.","<p>that sounds really heartbreaking. it is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side. it sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking ""care of myself"" while the rest sorts itself out. while i admire your desire and courage to stay friends - the ""extreme pain"" that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself. since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you i would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you don't end up feeling strung along or resentful. make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time - we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken.&nbsp;</p>"
"i just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. my family and i really need this job.

i feel like my time is going too fast,"<p>thank you for reaching out! that is a great question! as an american, i can truly say that i spend way too much time on the go! it is a proven fact that americans live in a fast paced environment compared to europe! i often ask myself, what if i only had one day left on this earth? what would i do? well, that is an easy question. i would spend it with my family! easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of world, right? its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.</p><p>time management is a very important factor when learning to &#34;live life to the fullest&#34;! in fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. personally, for myself i like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. i always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. that way, if i do not get through the list, i am not stressing over the little things. when planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. a much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. there is discipline involved in this process. if you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.</p><p>these are just some ideas that i am throwing out there. again, everyone has their own style on time management. i hope this was helpful for you. please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!</p>"

"my fiancé and i have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good. the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasn't getting enough sexual attention from me. 

i recently found out he cheated on me with another women.  he says he wants his family back but i'm confused on what to do.  is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should i just move on?","<p>i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question. &nbsp;i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again? &nbsp;once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. &nbsp;</p><p>first, if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the ""long haul"", so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again, that is completely do-able and possible if you both put in the work. &nbsp;but, there's a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. &nbsp;you say your relationship is ""good"", but there's been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. &nbsp;would you agree with that, or what are your thoughts? &nbsp;were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? &nbsp;if you are more of an emotional person than he is, you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn't been meeting your emotional needs. &nbsp;for instance, if you hadn't been feeling loved, cared about, validated, appreciated, cherished, and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. &nbsp;this is a common issue with couples, and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. &nbsp;in essence, many women tend to have more emotional needs than men, this is the way we are hard-wired, and there are exceptions to this of course, but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal! &nbsp;until he understands this, and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally, you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally (and sexually). &nbsp;this leads to you both being frustrated, but if all this is ringing true to you, he seriously probably has no clue what's going on and may not know how you're feeling. &nbsp;you need to communicate your needs to him; if you are super lost with how to do that, there's an awesome book called the five love languages. &nbsp;it's not that long, and it's very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening; really!!</p><p>this is a long post, i'm sorry! &nbsp;but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. &nbsp;so back to the second direction you can go....you feel very betrayed, you aren't sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. &nbsp;for instance, if he says he is working late, or if he doesn't call or text right away when he usually does, you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. &nbsp;of course, it may not be true, he may have legit reasons for his behaviors, but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia-mode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you, then the trust may not be able to be re-built. &nbsp;you need to think long and hard about this, and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty, then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. &nbsp;you can't just tell him vaguely ""i need to trust you again""; if he wants his family back and he's willing to do the work, you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. &nbsp;but, be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren't attracted to him anymore (or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren't meeting his physical needs)...if he throws that out there, but you weren't showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally, then it all starts with you communicating that to him. &nbsp;get that book!</p><p>in conclusion, if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he's cheating when his behavior isn't spot on, you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. &nbsp;there is certainly a way to work through this, but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. &nbsp;rebuilding trust can be a long process, maybe even years, and for some people, they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past. &nbsp;i truly recommend starting with the book, and then going from there. &nbsp;if you decide you want to stay with him, you would really benefit from couples counseling, as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again.</p>"

i'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","<p>how frustrating to want a relationship with someone who does not feel similarly!</p><p>the person who needs to be at the top of your list of those whose interest you consider, is yourself.</p><p>most often, staying engaged in dialogue, affection, sex, with someone who has different reasons than you have, for doing so, creates longing, frustration and sadness.</p><p>since the guy has told you he would like limiting his involvement with you, more than likely you will be protecting yourself from disappointed wishes, by taking his words seriously.</p><p>since you've made your interest in him clear, it sound like he's taking advantage of what you're willing to offer him.</p><p>as long as he's not reciprocating with the involvement you'd like, why continue being available to him?</p><p>the one area that is open to you in a positive way, is to understand which qualities of this guy you find attractive.</p><p>by understanding more about your own interests about a potential partner, the stronger you will be able to step away from those who would like you for their reasons, which have nothing or very little in common &nbsp;with yours.</p><p>good luck with defining the qualities of a partner with who you will feel fulfilled by sharing yourself.</p>"

this whole decision would be easier if you would just tell us what to do.,"you’re at a crossroads about what to do and part of you is hopeful that someone else will make the decision for you. this decision is really weighing on you. it feels like it might be easier if someone else gave you the answer. you'd prefer for someone to give you the answer. i can tell you what to do. what do you want to know? it would be better if you made the decision for yourself. i don't know what's best for you. sometimes decisions come from yourself, you take the direction of your life. im not here to tell you what to do."
every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather.  how can i fight this?,"<p>sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin d, when the sun isn't naturally out. also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? if for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.</p>"
i would quit if i had another way to cope with all the stress,"you’re starting to think about what it would take to quit for good. in order to be successful, you’d need to find a new coping mechanism. you know you need a coping mechanism in place to quit. there are many healthy ways to cope with stress. let's talk about a few options now. what else have you tried? giving up isn't always the best option, think about it. if you have another way to cope with allthe stress you can go with that so that your stress will release what if we try to develop other ways for you to cope? usually exercise and meditation are two ways people try to cope with stress. let's also think about your sleep, which is just as important."

"hello, i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. i know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. 

i have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before. i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. 

what can i do?","<p>do you have a close friend or relative who's opinion you trust? ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does. if they don’t see these qualities in you, then it may be your cousin’s issue and she’s taking it out on you. you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know, specifically, what she is expecting. then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are, it's her issue and she is not coming from a place of love.</p><p>even if you do resemble her comments, the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love. the fact that you're introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you. </p>"

"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  now he is depressed and hopeless again.","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. this is a very serious time. i don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. the time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. it is very important, after hospitalization,&nbsp;to get&nbsp;follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. if your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. it is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. this is good support for him and you.</p><p>it is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. means really do matter.&nbsp; so, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. you can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. firearms are very lethal. i am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. this is where your support system can help out. people can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.</p><p>if you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. if he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. i know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. calling 9-1-1 is always&nbsp;a&nbsp;good option if you are not sure. </p><p>usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. but, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. so, it is always good to have a plan. </p><p>if you want more information, call the national suicide prevention lifeline. they will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. they can help you create a specific safety plan. </p><p><br></p><p>i do hope things work out alright. be well. </p><p><br></p><p>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
"i just got out of a two year relationship. i broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. he was talking to other women and lying about it. it pushed me away and hurt me, but i'm still in love with him. a couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. he told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. i cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. our whole relationship was only us. we didn't have friends. it was me and him against the world. we didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. we hung out constantly and skyped to sleep every single night. then, when i cut myself, we talked on skype. he cried and told me ""i'm still in love with you, i never stopped loving you,"" and i cried tears of joy. i asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. he promised and assured me he loved me. he came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. he went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. he told me i wasn't attractive, i wasn’t beautiful to him, and that i changed. he also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. i'm still in love with him. why do i love him? how do i stop? just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. that i wasn't good enough and that i'm no longer beautiful hurts me. i think i need a therapist, but don't know if i should.","<p>i am very sorry for the pain you are suffering. losing the most&nbsp;significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. there will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. with that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support&nbsp;may be necessary for healing to take place. anytime&nbsp;sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately.&nbsp;a therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going&nbsp;through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. while starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task,&nbsp;it will only make things easier and give you a&nbsp;sense of hope and purpose for your future. with the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related&nbsp;to living a more fullfilling life. hang in there. with&nbsp;a support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier.&nbsp;best of luck to you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>"

"i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex, but when it comes to the actual penetration, i hate it. i don't know why, but i just want it to be over. i feel like crying. i don't know why i don’t like it because all of my friends enjoy it.","although i am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area, an initial question i have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing.? &nbsp;if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over. &nbsp;i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time &nbsp;until you figure out what is going on. &nbsp;i encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations, if any, &nbsp;about being sexually active. &nbsp;do you fear pregnancy? &nbsp;are there problems in the relationship? &nbsp;are you afraid of the emotional intimacy?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way. &nbsp; when these types of traumatic events occur, &nbsp;people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma. &nbsp;such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with. &nbsp;if this is the case i strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>a final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration. &nbsp;if so, i would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems. &nbsp;although pain can also be associated with emotional issues, it is always good to rule out possible physical causes. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>i hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction. &nbsp;take care.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>"

i was born a girl. i look like a boy. i sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. i don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. i just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"<p>if you're feeling like your gender is different than the gender you are born with, and there are many different terms to help describe that. gender is actually looked at on a spectrum. transgender is just one of those terms, but looking at the information here may help:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.transequality.org/about-transgender"">http://www.transequality.org/about-transgender</a>. i'm not saying that you should use the term transgender to describe yourself because that may not accurately describe what you are experiencing, but i'm just trying to point you to some more resources.</p><p>as for what to say to someone who asks your gender, that becomes a question with a lot of different parts. this is probably something that would be best talked out with someone else who you trust. i don't know whether that is your family, friends, and mental health professional, and member of the clergy, or someone else. there are many different things than you could say and they are all related to how much you already to share with other people about how you feel regarding your gender.</p><p>generally, i would suggest it would be important to become comfortable with how you feel yourself and possibly tell some people whom you really trust first. also consider that once you tell someone something, it's not possible to undo it, so if you tell someone, they may tell someone else. then there is also the matter of people having very different reactions related to different genders and not everyone will be supportive. i hope that you are able to surround yourself with some people who are willing to understand and work through this with you so that you have some ideas how to react if you come across someone who does not understand.</p><p>please remember that there is always someone to talk with.</p>"
it's really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who don't put any effort into nourishing our relationship.,"<p>one thing i would ask is ""why are you still hanging with those {<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">friends}</span>?"" a relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. i would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, i always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is one-sided, it is inevitable that it will start to de-compensate. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, </span>everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.</p><p>hope this helps, <br></p><p>c<br></p>"

my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though i'm in my 20s. she argues with me over stupid stuff.,"<p>this is a common issue. you grow up gradually, and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance. i'm all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom.&nbsp;</p><p>ultimately, you only have control over yourself, so that's the place to start. you can remind yourself that mom's behaviours don't mean that she doesn't trust you or love you; it's just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range. if you can see her responses as habits, rather than a reflection of how she feels about you, then you can keep yourself calm. the more calm you are, the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>take a look at the picture from her perspective. she may feel overwhelmed with finances (are you in college?), and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesn't know how to recruit help for. i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you, cleaning, cooking, doing laundry...all those thankless mom tasks. take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? can you see that underneath the nagging there's a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? &nbsp;okay, so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. she wants help. you want respect. let's talk about how you get both.</p><p>i propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic. ""mom...i see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen. can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want?"" sell it as ""win-win"". then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">the first part is stuff that's your business and your business alone: things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships and hygiene.... mom's voice has no place in these arenas, unless you are storing food in your room and it's a health hazard. this is a ""mom says nothing about"" list.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>the second part is about what mom needs from you. what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. does she want you to contribute to rent? buy your own food? do your own laundry? what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom? how will these things be enforced? what will happen if you don't follow through? write it all down so it's really clear. it has to all be mutually agreed upon.</p><p>the third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you, and how you talk to her. you can let her know that you don't want to be told what to do or when to do it; that doesn't work when you're 20 years old. listen to what she wants too. beyond the contract you've just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, it's optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, you'd be more willing to help out. and, i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. go for the win-win.&nbsp;</p><p>i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom. :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
i'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. everything is a constant reminder.  how do i move on?,"<p>hi,&nbsp;</p><p>break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. it's important that you don't compare yourself to others. each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. here are a few tips to help with your recovery:&nbsp;</p><p>1. make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.&nbsp;</p><p>2. although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, &amp; vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). the last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that's what we need the most. but when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. that's exactly the same when it comes to emotional&nbsp;pain. take care of yourself, keep&nbsp;yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.&nbsp;</p><p>3. as much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. you might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. and also block social media reminders. there is a lot of wisdom in the saying ""out of sight, out of mind.""&nbsp;</p><p>4. once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. in a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.&nbsp;</p><p>5. if possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset&nbsp;and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>6. in addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, i would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.&nbsp;</p>"

"i've been with my husband for eight years now. we have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. i took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. however, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. during that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child.

the baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. he said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything. he said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, i would still accuse him. he's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because i'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.

i'm of course hurt and in shock. i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart. i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought.","<p>hi jayuya, i'm struggling in this moment with my own biases. i have biases that are about respect and every individual's need for and right to respect. your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same. he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours. and now, in an attempt to manipulate and silence you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him? there aren't many crumbs of this cake left for you, are there?</p><p>so, my biases about respect don't make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do; i can't do that, and i don't think either of those things will help you. i'd like to ask you some questions though...</p><p>are you happy? do you know what happy is? do you know what respect is? are your children safe? are your children witnessing violence (because if they are, then they're not safe)? do you have supports? do your family and friends know what's happening in your life? have you ever been to a women's shelter? are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly? that's what i suggest. these are big decisions, you deserve some support. i wish you the best.</p>"
"i'm going through a divorce with my wife of three years, who i've known since the 4th grade and been involved with for seven years! we just had a baby seven months ago and never got along with my mother, who i've lived with for years. i am now back with my mother because i have nowhere to go with this divorce looming. i'm heart broken because i fell into a depression, i haven't seen my child in a while, i'm having good and bad dreams, and i feel hated. can you help? can you intervene? can i speak with someone?","<p>it's hard to accept the end of a marriage when it's not your choice; you feel powerless, abandoned and unwanted. your wife has the right to decide not to be in a marriage with you, and a therapist can help you accept and move through this change that has broken your heart and left you lost. you don't indicate why you haven't seen your child, and you may want to consult with a lawyer about the laws in your area and how to gain access to your baby. therapists don't intervene in these ways. the marriage may be ending, but your role as a loving father is only beginning. &nbsp;you can focus on giving your child the gift of two parents who respect each other.</p>"
what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client?,"<p>each counselor will have their own list of ""difficulties"" in doing therapy work with a client. &nbsp;even if clinically trained similarly, since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humans.</p><p>on my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another, feels very deep.</p><p>sometimes i feel like avoiding the pain i feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks about.</p><p>what in fact is necessary to clear out their pain, is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain isn't greater than who they are.</p>"

"my fiancé and i have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good. the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasn't getting enough sexual attention from me. 

i recently found out he cheated on me with another women.  he says he wants his family back but i'm confused on what to do.  is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should i just move on?","<p>hello. thank you for your question. many couples that experience infidelity in their relationship face this important question - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should i just move on?""</span>&nbsp;</p><p>deciding to stay or leave is such a personal decision, one that only you can make.</p><p>when an affair is disclosed or found out, it can have a traumatic impact on the betrayed partner. the betrayed partner might be overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts - wanting answers to specific questions - wanting details. and the partner that had the affair might be feeling overwhelm around ""will their partner ever forgive them?"" ""will they trust them again?"" ""how long will it take to regain their trust again?""&nbsp;</p><p>while it is possible for couples to get past the cheating, it does take a commitment from each partner to do the work needed. because of the complexities cheating has on the bond couples have with each other, i would recommend seeing a couple therapist that specializes in working with the issue of infidelity. when infidelity happens, there are usually a number of secrets that accompany it, and this can be incredibly difficult for couples to work through on their own.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
"i start counseling/therapy in a few days (i'm freaking out) but my main fear is that i'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?",<p>many people cry during their therapy sessions. actually most people cry in their therapist's office. i tell my clients that it's safe to cry in my office and crying isn't a sign of weakness. it's a normal human response to pain. people actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying. crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many people.<br></p>

how can i stop it? i know the mistakes that i've made in my life. i'm having a really hard time getting back on my feet. can you help me please?","<p>i want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it.  you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization.  a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way.  until you realize there is a problem you won’t start looking for a solution.</p><p>don’t misunderstand me!  the abuse is not your fault! you are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed. </p><p>first, go and buy the book “boundaries: where you end and i begin” by anne katherine.  read it.  this book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it.  you will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.</p><p>be single for a while.  stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own.  often we get in a relationship because of a need.  if you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons.  the first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life.  identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.</p><p>i was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife.  this was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you.  however, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship.  obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies.  the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person.  when she looked at him in our session and said to him “i don’t need you. i want you.  but not if you are going to continue to act like this.  so you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready to make some changes.”  she stuck to that, too.  he didn’t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay.  she had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. she was fully prepared to be single again.  they actually did end up working things out in the end.</p><p>you can’t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly.  sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides.  couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work.  you may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you.  a therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. but you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries.  that means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you.  someone can’t do that if they are too scared to be alone.  if they feel they need the other person in their life. </p><p>these patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents.  when someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know.  even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still don’t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people.  something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome.  be patient with yourself and find a good therapist.  you can’t change your partner.  work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay.  the more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become.</p>"
"my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that i'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when i don't mean it like that. for example, she gets offended when i call someone at work ""sweetheart.""  i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her.  she doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. how do i get her to understand?","hello. that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. it may bear clarifying how each of you define ""infidelity"". currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. if there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, ""i feel you distancing from me."" in other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. if so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. if this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a ""sweetheart."" the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean ""you're so sweet and kind"", ""my dear"", or in a flirtatious manner to mean ""sweetie."" the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. &nbsp;if she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, ""i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much."" therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? that said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.</div><div><br></div><div>the last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. in the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. this pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""i'm sorry."" however, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. in my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""i'm sorry"", i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. if neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>for more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.psychologyresource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.</div><div><br></div>"
"i have an eating disorder of binging. i've had gastric sleeve surgery. i need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. i have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.","<p>hi anaheim,</p><p>relationships with therapists have some things in common with other relationships; they work best if there is dialogue about what your hopes, thoughts, emotions and needs are. are you letting your therapist know what your goals are? it's okay to say ""i'd really like us to focus on this piece"", or ""i'm looking for specific direction about how to manage this part"". your therapist is wise if they ask questions that determine what your needs are, but they can't read your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>not every therapist will be a good fit for you. i know i'm not a good fit for everyone i meet. we have different styles; some are more &nbsp;passive and focus on listening. this might be the type of therapist you have. for some people this is what they want, but maybe it's not for you. maybe you want someone who digs at you more, asks more questions, gives you strategies, lets you know what they think... someone more active. if this is the case, it doesn't mean s/he's a bad therapist...it's just not what you're looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>sometimes people think they can't end sessions with their therapist; they might be worried about hurt feelings. but, in the end, you don't owe your therapist anything if you feel it's not working or it's not a good match. just move on and try someone new. maybe ask them questions first about their style, even.&nbsp;</p><p>best of luck!</p>"

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">hello, and thank you for your question. the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you. however, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask

</span></span></span><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals? this is important, because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not
happy when they do that. however, if monogamy is not something you value, then
perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you. not all people want monogamous relationships, and that
is alright. finally,&nbsp;if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values. that can only be determined by you. </font></p><p>

is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt. we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. perhaps the
question to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband,
is this the pattern that you want to keep? the pattern of very little sex,
argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. </font></p><p>

"i cannot stop thinking about how i am hurting my baby by continuing smoking. but i cannot stop. and the more i think about it, the more i smoke and feel bad about it.","if you could find a way to quit that you knew would work for you, you'd definitely give it a try.   you really want to quit but you’re unsure how since you haven’t been successful in the past. you know that smoking is bad for you and for your baby.
 you see you're hurting your baby, so let's make a plan to help you quit smoking. isn't your baby worth it to quit? you need to stop smoking to begin with. try to do something else to distract you. it would hurt you more to stop cold turkey. give it time and slowly try to take yourself away from the smoking. your baby is the biggest reason why it's generating a life, so get over it."
"i empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that i actually feel physical pain. this has made life difficult to say the least.

i believe i have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. but since it's such a new disorder i can't find any information about it. could this be what is going on with me?","<p>sometimes it's helps to have a name for a problem - it can make you feel less alone as in, ""oh there's a name for this and other people have this experience too."" on the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in ""now i have a special problem that has a special name, and that's an important part of who i am.""<br><br>bottom line, whether it's a disorder or not, you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other people's energy and feelings. you might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy (just like the volume dial or button on the tv) that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel what's going on but it's not so ""loud"". you can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being, letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far. this is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability. just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else, your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted.</p>"

"i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?","<p>fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance i'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. we would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie batman begins, bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said ""i'm scared of snakes"", i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattan</p><p>hope that helps <br></p><p>c<br></p>"

"i know i'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make.  i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life, but i just can't seem to even though i really want to. why can't i force myself to change?","hello, and thank you for your question. changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important. here are a few things i would suggest:<br><br>1. get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that can be changed. sometimes we will set a goal like, ""i want to be more confident"" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. <br><br>2. if you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. so, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. <br><br>3. if you are going to make changes, really nail down why you want to make them. what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? for example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. <br><br>4. once you know why you want to make these changes, i strongly suggest setting small goals. if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. so, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. <br><br>5. as sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help. <br><p><br></p><p>be well,</p><p>robin landwehr, dbh, lpcc<br></p>"

does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"<p>there are multiple ways that counseling helps people. the most basic is that it gives you someone to talk to about and through what you are facing. it is better than a friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and don't have to worry about the other side. this is also a place where you do not have to worry about how else the other person is involved in the situation. beyond this basic level, a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people, including you, can effectively deal with this kind of situation. the counselor may also be aware of connections that you would not otherwise see. a good counselor will also recognize if and when you need other help or support in the situation. why wouldn't you benefit from having someone walk with you in your journey to peace and wholeness.&nbsp;</p>"

"these things happened to me for all of year six and seven and no-one did anything. how come now i’m getting into trouble now for doing the same thing they did to me? because i’m new here, i’m just showing them they can’t mess with me. once everyone knows i’m not a loser i’ll be right. it ain’t fair. nobody helped me out in my old school.","it feels unfair that you have different consequences than the kids at your previous school. no one had your back when you were being treated poorly. you used to be bullied at your last school. you've never had the opportunity to process what happened. you want the other kids to know they can't mess with you. don't compare yourself to other people. that won't get you anywhere. didn't you tell a teacher? calm down, that's part of it, things aren't always as they should be, but do what's right. this is a new school and time for a fresh start. let's not look back on past problems and start fresh. you aren't a loser just because you're new. you are not a loser but taking out your anger onto others will not make things any better. you'll just feel even more resentful and angry. and i'm here helping you out now so there are people willing to listen."
i worry that i’m being too hasty in my decision to end this pregnancy.  maybe i should wait and think it over,"while at one time your mind was made up about your pregnancy, you’re starting to think that maybe you need to revisit your decision. this feels like a big decision. you want to be sure you don't make it lightly. you're realizing you need to think on this a bit longer. if you wait much longer, it will be a more difficult and a longer recovery. you should make a decision in the next couple days. you're considering abortion?? ending a pregnancy is no easy thing,  perhaps you can try discussing the matter with your partner to weigh the pros and cons of ending it. pregnancy is two lives and if it's something that doesn't harm your health, take care until the end, when it's born, donate to someone. if you feel like that's what you should do then i think that's a great idea."
"tonight, my husband seemed to put our son down through an incorrect approach. his approach was perfectly wrong. i found myself defending my son. i told him that what he did was not the way to encourage our son.
instead of watching my husband’s harsh behavior i decided to sit beside my son and, together, we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study. my husband got upset and he was swearing at me. he threatened me. i knew that he was not joking. his words scared me a lot!","<p>i have had these many cases, but in situations like this.... if it does get out of hand, the police do need to be involved. sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective.&nbsp;</p>"
"i have suffered many things at home and school. we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that, but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing. i try to fill it in with objects or, in this case, a woman.","<p>there are a lot of ways to look at this. it sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support. i wonder what it is that you feel when you're not in a relationship?</p><p>because of the way you asked the question, i'm getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships. i wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone. even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner, having friends is still an important element.</p><p>i wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself (as far as emotions) when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one.</p><p>perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself.</p><p>in general, it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others (in this case, relationship has many meanings and degrees). most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days, thoughts, feelings, etc. with someone else who we trust and care about – also hoping they care about us in return.</p>"
i've recently thought that i could be transgender but i've never had the mind of a girl.,"<p>hello frostproof,</p><p><br></p><p>thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different. &nbsp;this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues. &nbsp;from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the ""labeling system"". &nbsp;while labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining. &nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;

"what am i doing wrong? my wife and i are fighting all the time. what can i do? we don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how i feel. she is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. i'm not a family-oriented person. i only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.  

my mother forced my father out of my life so i do not know who he really is. we've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much i look like her when in fact i look more like him.  this makes me mad because i don't want to look like my mother. i hate her. all that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.  i need guidance in my life.  i don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. i'm dying to make our relationship healthy. i've never wanted anything more than this. please help me. i need your advice.","<p>hello. it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. there are no easy answers to your questions, and i won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. first and foremost, cut yourself some slack. no one is perfect. we fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. you have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.</p><p>joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. you can find these through local counseling resources. sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. if you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.</p><p>lastly, parents are imperfect. yep...its true. they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. we limp along and do our best. having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. both with ourselves, and toward other people. so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. &nbsp;i am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. if only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. that's not fair. so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. all of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. one way or the other, you will benefit from it.</p><p>be well.</p>"
"i am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the united states. i faced a cultural shock, and i was so depressed when i arrived here. my counselor in the university was my savior. he helped me a great deal. now i am going back to my country for a vacation. i was thinking to get him something special with my country's name on it, and i remembered that he likes wine. my country is known for that. is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after christmas?","<p>i don't think it's appropriate to give your counselor a bottle of wine. your counselor helped you and supported you, which is great, but a gift is inappropriate. i can understand that you want to show your gratitude. there are many other ways to do that. you could drop your counselor a note or card, thank him in person, or tell him how much he helped you. these small gestures can be very meaningful for both of you.&nbsp;</p>"
"when my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. when i ask what is wrong, i get nothing: no reply, no phone call. if he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","<p>this has to be very difficult to endure.</p><p>it's pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict. very often, one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait. one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like ""i cannot talk about this now, but we can talk about it in two hours.""</p><p>my best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship, either romantic or in childhood. if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it, it would be good to know what that is. it could even be that he's learned to handle conflict that way.</p><p>something else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not. these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couples.</p><p>as far as what you can do now, perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before, that you love him and believe that he loves you, or some other statements that are true for you. you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself. for example, you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure.</p>"
"about 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. for me it seemed out of the blue. i don't miss her as much as i used to but i just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who i have known since my childhood not even my family. i'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, i've just shut down. i haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. i'm scared to because i don't want it to be taken away from me again. i feel like ever lesson i learn only last a day. i just don't know what to do. i'm working at a place i know i should enjoy. i'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc. i'm doing everything the books say i should do, but i don't feel any different. i just don't know what to do.","<p>since you realize your sense of trust was broken, withdrawing from close relationships, makes sense.</p><p>this may be your self giving you natural time to recuperate from emotional pain.</p><p>also it is your chance to think over how to handle yourself differently in future relationships.</p><p>maybe this process requires more time than you'd like.</p><p>having patience is very difficult when a person feels hurt.</p><p>a therapist of your own may be a good idea so you have someone for guidance and to chart your progress w you.</p><p>this may feel less lonely and help you tolerate the waiting period till you're better</p>"
"i was in a relationship with him for three years. my mom doesn't like it because she thinks i'm making a mistake. he got married a few months after we broke up, and now he is divorced. i forgave him for what he did in the past, and he says he’s sorry and he really loves me. i love him too, but is it bad that i'm giving him a second chance again?","<p>hey, it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes. your mom wants to protect you; i get that. maybe she is worried you'll be hurt again. were you hurt in some way by him? can you understand where she's coming from?&nbsp;</p><p>sometimes when we're mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom, it's hard to know how to repair mom's relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite. can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong; that the picture you may have painted of him isn't the total picture? she might need help there.&nbsp;</p><p>thank your mom for her love and care, and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether you're together or not, that it's a risk you are going to take, and that you really need her support. :)</p>"
"i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. i have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. i feel like i'm always on the edge or just apathetic.  can i fix this by myself?",<p>i will not say that you can't but i will say it will be much harder and the time may take much longer.&nbsp; getting help and having someone to be there with you through the ups and down of ptsd makes the journey much easier.&nbsp; <br></p>
"i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. not a year ago, i had a car accident. could this experience add more problems?","<p>you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative. &nbsp;it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiences.</p><p>if you have been deployed to a combat area, you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers. &nbsp;the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma. here's a link to a directory of vet centers:</p><p>http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/vetcenter.asp<br></p><p>your service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>"
"i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to, i never fully meet what they want. i feel that when i finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. i feel like  they just want nothing to do with me.",<p>as long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted.&nbsp; how about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those.&nbsp; make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic. <br></p>
"i have three siblings. my mom loves them and not me. she’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. i’m always crying in my room.","<p>have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? while i hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?</p>"
"he is an adolescent. he has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years, all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video. we have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment, but after a few months of having then back, he pees his pants again.","from a behavioral standpoint you should refrain from punishing your son. &nbsp;instead of utilizing punishment when he wets himself provide contingencies prior to any accidents. &nbsp;sit down with your son and discuss the importance of utilizing the bathroom and responsibilities and inform him that if he chooses to wet his pants that his video games will not be available for use for him the next day(or your designated realistic time frame).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>&nbsp;this way if an accident occurs, no heated words have to be exchanged because you have already laid the ground work. &nbsp;also allow him to clean up himself. &nbsp;gather cleaning supplies and and oversee cleaning operations without ridicule or negative feedback. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>since you have stated that you have an adolescent who is experiencing enuresis, you may want to check with your pcp and a licensed professional for underlying diagnosis that can be treated. &nbsp; you can also call a local behavioral analyst.</div></div>"
"my ex-wife married and used me to have a child. she now uses that child as a pawn. i know my child misses me, but i need to move on and not live in the past. how do i do this? do i see my child as much as possible or very little? is it more confusing for the child?","<p>the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks it's their fault.&nbsp;</p><p>as hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. this makes the belief even more strong for them. they start to think, ""why does dad keep leaving? what am i doing to keep making him go away?""</p><p>i believe a child needs both parents in their life. whether she used you for a child or not, that child still exists and never asked for this. they didn't ask to be born into drama and two parents that can't make things work.&nbsp;</p><p>you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child. if you start over far away, this may mean less visits but you'll still be a part of their life. just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it. every child deserves that much.&nbsp;</p><p>good luck to you! :-)</p>"
i'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. everything is a constant reminder.  how do i move on?,"<p>let yourself know what you feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>there is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them.</p><p>probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders, the sooner you will feel fresh and new again.</p>"
"i'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. 

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?","<p>thanks for reaching out. this is a great question. communication is definitely a 2-way street. one person cannot participate in a discussion. it takes a talker and a listener. furthermore, communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying. &nbsp;since i can't ask you questions about what is going on, i am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when i work with couples. one person focuses more on solving the issue, than listening to their partner. &nbsp;this can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be ""heard.""</p><p>i understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. that can be really frustrating and difficult and i want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.</p><p>one of the best strategies to gettting heard, is actually to be a good listener to someone else. i know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? you want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening. but this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. in other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on.&nbsp;</p><p>here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:</p><ul><li>pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. no texting or distractions. lean in. focus.</li><li>listen for content and for emotion. clarify what you don't understand. try to understand the person's underlying emotions.&nbsp;</li><li>don't rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on.&nbsp;</li><li>encourage the other person to continue speaking, nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.</li><li>ask questions to get to understand the other person's point of view.<br></li></ul><div>i believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. if you don't find that this doesn't spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. if there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. if communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.<br></div><div><br></div><div>best of luck to you!</div>"
"in the last ten months, i've been kicked out, moved around three times, worked many jobs, stopped school to make money, had dad and mom get sick, was cheated on while pregnant, lost my baby, had relationship issues, and was betrayed. i can't get a job. i have no friends. i feel lonely and isolated. i've been dealing with all this by myself.","<p>one thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over. if you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day, this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices. for example, you say you can't get a job, but i wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job, like career link. you say you have no friends currently. are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact with?</p><p>you mentioned that you have no friends. is there anyone in your life that you can talk with, even if it's not someone that you consider a closest friend?</p>"
"i have no self control over food. most people stop when they've had enough, but i keep eating for the pleasure of it. especially with sweets - i'm never done eating dessert.","<p>i would recommend removing yourself from the environment you are in after you have finished eating. a simple walk around the block, calling up a friend and going to visit, or even going to another room in the house can help. if you find that you truly have no self control over food, i recommend attending overeaters anonymous; a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related to food. i hope this helps. </p>"
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"<p>as far as i can tell, you received unwanted attention, but you didn't do anything wrong. &nbsp;what did your instructor say? anything? if the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell you--if he/she didn't then assume the swimsuit was okay, but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment, in order to get that attention. &nbsp;if you don't want his attention then you have a couple of choices--wear a shirt &nbsp;over the swim top, find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have, or wear what you have as long as the instructor doesn't say anything, and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident, slightly loud, voice as you can muster. &nbsp;""i don't appreciate your critique of what i'm wearing, we're here to take a class, let's just focus on that. then, &nbsp;turn on your heel and walk away.</p>"
i get very nervous and anxious/scared before sex.,"<p>i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to. i don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.</p><p>there is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performance-related) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.</p><p>having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. if your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.</p><p>another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. all of this can be part of your discussions. when you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. you may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.</p><p>if this feels pretty structured, it is initially. generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.</p><p>if the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">some</span> of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).</p><p>if this is difficult for you to sort out on your own, consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.</p>"
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?,"<p>this happens slowly and can be done.</p><p>you already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself, not that the feelings of self-loathing are the best of what you're able to expect from life.</p><p>a way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisions.</p><p>if you start to notice what you'd like from an interaction, and afterwards, reflect on how well you handled yourself, especially with any unexpected circumstances, you'll build confidence in your ability to be good at something.</p><p>do you know why you hate yourself?</p><p>this answer may help you address within yourself , a new type self talk which has more positives in it than what you've been accustomed to telling yourself.</p>"
i know you think i’m a fool to continue this pregnancy.,"what others think about your decision is important to you. you feel like you might be judged based on the decision you make. you think i think you're a fool. i do think you should reconsider an abortion. why are you worried about what i think? of course you’re not a fool, no one can tell you what to do with your body as you have that right. they can give you options to make a decision easier for you, but calling you a fool for keeping your baby is idiotic. no, just carry on with a life in there that depends very well on you. i do not think you are a fool at all, i think it's quite commendable. what can i do to help?"
"something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for. when i think about what happened, i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","<p>hi ohio, i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others. my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot. that's a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce. i'll get you started.</p><p>you feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident. is it triggering some old shame?&nbsp;unfortunately, a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids. it doesn't work. when&nbsp;was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame, as in ""i'm bad"", or&nbsp;""i'm worthless""? is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasn't your fault? sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent, sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma.&nbsp;</p><p>if so, picture yourself at that age. can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isn't their fault? can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them?&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">that's your first goal...to go to the source of the shame and heal that child's wound with compassion. what happens to children is never their fault (and fault is a pretty useless concept anyway).</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">once you take the layers of old ""i'm bad"" shame off, the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame. here are some things you can say to yourself...every day...</span></p><ul><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i'm human and that's okay. i don't have to be perfect.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i can have compassion for my mistakes.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i can feel proud that i'm facing my mistake and making things right.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i deserve forgiveness and compassion, and i have that for other people too.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">there's no purpose to holding on to shame.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i can learn from my mistakes and move forward.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">everyone makes mistakes.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">other people don't want me to carry this shame around.</span></li><li><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i don't need shame to remind me not to do it again. i've figured that out.</span></li></ul><div>shame tries to convince you that you need to carry ""it"" around in order to prevent further mistakes. poppycock. &nbsp;you've learned your lesson, now you can move forward to other mistakes. sorry...but you're human and you'll keeping making... hopefully different, glorious mistakes. embrace the learning. lean into the experiences of life. it's all juicy stuff, and you're in good company; we're all in the same position of being mortal.</div><div><br></div><p><br></p>"
"i have been feeling more and more down for over a month. i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of.","it could be really helpful to see a counselor/therapist about your increasing depression/panic symptoms. finding out the cause of depression/anxiety isn't always as straightforward as it seems, since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific trigger/reason. for example, if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life, then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down, and typically i'll start to see a lot more that i get down about, and it can really build very quickly on itself. same with anxiety. obviously, this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained, but that's where working with a counselor/therapist comes in.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic, and if you can (through the panic attack) continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations. even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you're feeling - such as saying to yourself ""okay, i'm breathing really rapidly, and my heart is racing, now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight..."" reminding yourself that it's just your body's reaction to stress, and while it might be overreacting right now, you're okay and eventually it will go away. i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece, and i wouldn't be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too.&nbsp;</div>"

"yeah, i know i should always use protection when i have sex, and i know i should tell my partner.  but what difference does it make? i take my meds, and besides, hiv don’t kill you like it used to, they got meds now. heck i know a couple of fellas that have had it for years and years, i mean a long time and they look real good.","being healthy is important to you. you take your medication as prescribed and you know not to mess around with missing doses. but, you do wonder if protective sex is really all that important to staying heathy.  right now the thought of potentially getting hiv from unprotected sex doesn't concern you all that much. now, if hiv could potentially kill you or there weren't the right meds to help manage it, then you might think differently.  you're not worried about hiv. your current medications won't protect you from every infection that can harm your body, leading to costly, time-consuming medical treatments.  so you're not worried about getting hiv because your friends looked good? did they feel good? do not contaminate yourself sexually, always protect yourself, this prevents the transmission of unwanted viruses. well, if those people didn't got the aids then it doesn't make any sense that you should follow their lead. hiv is still deadly and doesn't have a proper cure. so, you should not take any risk and use protection while having sex every time. how would you feel if your partner did not tell you they have hiv? how would you feel if they didn't use protection with you?"
"what do you mean i’m responsible? i don’t get that it’s my fault that other people forwarded the photo. i did it to be funny. she shouldn’t have had so much to drink and passed out at the party anyway. she was asking for it. i didn’t forward to everyone, just david and maybe one other guy. plus, she is always showing off her body anyway.  she is an exhibitionist. it is david’s fault.","you don’t feel any regret or remorse that the photo was forwarded without her consent. because of her reputation it feels she kind of deserved it. you're feeling a bit defensive about the decisions that you made. you forwarded a photo and don't feel you should be held responsible. you ruined her life. you should be ashamed of yourself. you thought that was a good idea? i think it is important to take responsibility so that we can learn from our mistakes. everyone makes mistakes, but the key is to recognize and change when its needed. don't blame other people, just be responsible for your actions and start to change. you are responsible for taking the photo and sending it out to others. when people are in a compromising position it is the human and kind thing to do to help them. not to mock their pain."
"i started dating a guy i met online. he told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. he took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. that was more than two decades ago. nothing on his record since.
i always believe the past should be left in past. but my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. should i forgive this man that i'm falling in love with or should i dump him? if i stay with him i will never see my family and granddaughter again.","<p>thank you for your question. trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. from what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. if you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. we cannot control others but only ourselves. respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. good luck to you.</p>"
"i'm currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and misophonia. also, i am 99% sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder. i read the dsm-iv, taken college psychology, etc. i know it in my heart i have them. is self-diagnosing okay with the right research?","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. here are a few reasons for this: </p><p>1. making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides&nbsp;matching up&nbsp;the symptoms of a disorder. to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor&nbsp;would consult the&nbsp;dsm, but they&nbsp;may also&nbsp;use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. </p><p>2. our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. we really can't be objective. something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. in addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. </p><p>3. sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible, in and of itself. for example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. </p><p>there are other reasons, but these are&nbsp;three important ones. now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? maybe not. you may be correct. but,&nbsp;it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. if a disorder is then found, you can begin to talk about treatment. </p><p>hope this was helpful. be well.</p><p><br></p><p>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"<p>hello. yes, counseling can be beneficial to many people. one of the effective components to effective therapy, is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling. i don't mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 45-50 minutes, but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place. this requires you to be vulnerable, capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself, and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable. therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly, honestly, and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals - your improvement of self. it does take time, and there are no quick fixes (usually), so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places. you'll thank yourself later, knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process. be well.</p>"

my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. she told me that she wants to move. what can i do to help her?  i want her to stay.,"<p>you're probably not going to like my answer.</p><p>your question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what you want.</p><p>addictions don't happen in a vacuum. if you've had any experience with addicts at all, then i'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". a lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.</p><p>you said she recently quit. you said she is depressed. she wants to move. when a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. they need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. it means moving to new locations. anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out why they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. she may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.</p><p>don't pressure her to stay. let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. if she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. it doesn't need to be made under pressure. that will only lead to resentment. support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. let her go. it sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.</p>"

"my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. i get less attention and little to no intercourse. he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. we live two hours from family, and when i leave home to see family, he'll text me saying ""whatever"" and ""leave me alone."" but when we're together, everything is okay. no fighting or anything. i love this man, but i just don't know what to do anymore.","<p>hi rockford, while no relationship is ""perfect"", and it's natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time, because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we don't have to smother each other with attention anymore, your situation sounds like something different.&nbsp;</p><p>""he has no time for me""... yet you don't fight. hmmm...is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? are you avoiding conflict? many people do. what do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? as an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real. or maybe you have spoken to him about it. if so, what happens? does he listen and help you understand him better? or does he avoid and reassure you...or maybe dismiss you? this is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together.&nbsp;</p><p>he says ""leave me alone"". that's a pretty bold statement about what he wants. he doesn't seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is, and how close you want to be. plus, i have to say, those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be!&nbsp;</p><p>giving him the benefit of the doubt, it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. but if this is true, he needs to tell you that so you can understand.&nbsp;</p><p>so, i suggest that the fact that when you're together you're ""okay"" is perhaps not the best barometer for how you're doing as a couple. listen to your gut. i encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. this may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what's not working, you won't know who you truly are as a couple. &nbsp;</p><p>when you're engaged, it's a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you're a married couple.&nbsp;</p>"

i have dog obsession disorder and i am having problems with my girlfriend because i am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. how do i get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"<p>hey, dogs are cool. they adore pleasing humans and often love to work on learning what you want and expect from them. your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. you are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. the first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. the skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. and keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships. </p>"

i need guidance and i believe that you can give it to me.  am i wrong for wanting him around? are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents? i do everything that they ask of me. i just want him to be around. when i ask my parents to let him be here, they call me a selfish person. please help me.","<p>you're not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your child.</p><p>do your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person? &nbsp;or, do they object only to electronic communication and don't want him involved in his child's life?</p><p>&nbsp;ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend. &nbsp;ask them also to understand your point of view.</p><p>now is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is born.</p><p>your mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for you.</p><p>consider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit. &nbsp;your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address these.</p><p>look online for women's resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this matter.</p><p>good luck with the remainder of your pregnancy, labor and delivery!</p><p><br></p>"

"i'm a teenager, and i just got my first job. i am a month and a half in. yesterday, my boss pushed me to the point where i had to go to the restroom and cry. she didn't see me, and i'm glad, but when i went to talk to her about it today, i let a tear or two come out. i hate it. i feel like they're not going to keep me anymore.","<p>getting your first job is an exciting, terrifying, and challenging experience. it is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker. you are literally ""learning as you go"" in this completely new environment. you are going to make mistakes. you are not going to get it right the first time. it can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. a couple of things to remember here: 1) you are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it, 2) there is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work, 3) you know best what you need in order to be successful. these three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. if you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. also let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand. becoming a successful worker doesn't happen overnight, but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesn't by communicating with your work team, the easier it will be for you. we all had a first job once, and were all worried about doing well. hang in there, and call a counselor if you need more help.<br></p>"
"my husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person. before, he worked and slept, and on off days, he'd stay home because he didn't want to do anything else. now he's going out with friends several nights a week while i'm still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself. he's suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, i'm remembering how i've been emotionally starving for the last five years.","<p>it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally &nbsp;could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression. obviously something has shifted which you do not understand. therefore, &nbsp;perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings? &nbsp;it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on. communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection, or shut down connection. imago dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches &nbsp;validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection.&nbsp;</p>"

how does a person start the counseling process?,"<p>hi! great question! my suggestion would be to google therapists in your area. &nbsp;one great website is called psychology today, which is a national site. &nbsp;you can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about. &nbsp;it's a great way to find out if they therapist has a speciality, accepts insurance and whether they offer a free phone consultation. i would then make a list of the ones that may be a good fit and then give them a call! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;hope this helps. remember you get to ask anything you need to, to determine if someone is a good fit. &nbsp;don't be afraid to ask anything! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;best of luck!</p>"

"i am divorced and happily remarried. our blended family of children are in their 20s. my youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. he was abusive to me, and i left with injuries. he never wanted kids, and i did. he paid child support only through forced wage earners. now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. i don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. i’m not sure how to handle this.","<p>hi arkansas,&nbsp;</p><p>your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. it's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. he's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. i've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. in some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. it's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it.&nbsp;</p><p>while you can't change his behaviours, and i think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.&nbsp;</p><p>for your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. he's trying to provoke you into acting ""crazy"", but you don't have to fall for this. if you run around screaming ""he's lying!"", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. one day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. they see who their dad is already, i'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. if he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. don't engage on his level.&nbsp;</p><p>don't blame your children completely. although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. they are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. you get the worst because they trust your love. but you can still have boundaries. letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. this picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.</p><p>reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. you don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. it may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.&nbsp;</p><p>i'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. good luck!</p><p><br></p>"

"my husband and i have been together for seven years now. i will be honest: i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened. ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. he gets so mad and ignores me for days. he's really verbally and emotionally abusive. he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. should we call it quits? i'm tired of crying, but we have a toddler together.","<p>hi texas, thanks for your honesty; it helps me know where to go in answering you. what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful/abusive/controlling with you, and then you ask ""should we call it quits?"". we? i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">the way your husband treats you is not your fault, texas. your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. the problem is not your lying. the problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">there's an analogy that i sometimes use; i don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so i will tell it to you.</span><br></p><p>if you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. if you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot; by the time it realises it's dying, it has lost its strength.&nbsp;</p><p>it's called ""learned helplessness"". when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you.&nbsp;</p><p>you have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. in my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>this is a complex picture, and if you were my client, i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you're seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child.&nbsp;</p><p>i sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist. i wish you the best.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
"i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?","<p>biologically, fear is designed to protect us from harm. fear is not always a bad thing, and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>a phobia, however, is different. you used the term ""fear"" rather than ""phobia"". a phobia is an irrational fear - meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. if your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.</p><p>everyone has fears, or things that make them nervous. public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. when you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. a lot of times, it is a self-esteem issue. you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue.&nbsp;</p><p>some fears are caused by trauma. someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into ""fight or flight"" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. in cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, i strongly urge you to seek a therapist - not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims.</p>"
i'm a 40 year old male and having erection problems. still have the desire for a woman. awfully frustrated. any suggestions? my doc doesn't want to discuss it.,"<p>hi there, first off i have to commend you for reaching out. it takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems. believe it or not, this problem is very common for men and women. </p><p>there are some things that you can try naturally, before resulting in medication, such as your eating habits and exercise. i would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day. do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly? how much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily?  these are just a few common things to look at. you would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies. our bodies are like a car. you have to maintenance it, in order for it to continue to run. </p><p><span>if you would like to get further natural advice and/or suggestions on eating healthy and exercising, i would recommend you see a nutritionist. a nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet. as far as your doctor, i would recommend looking into getting another doctor. i have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything. that appears to be a personal issue on their part. i hope i was helpful and i wish you the best of luck!</span></p>"
my husband and i are separated. he says he needs some time apart. he says he needs to get back the “in love” part of a relationship but doesn’t want to lose me. should i wait or start over new?,"<p>it's not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time. it is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent. if you and your husband have been together for quite some time it's likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other. while this is a good thing in some ways, it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that ""in love"" feeling he is referring to. couples simply become ambivalent. </p><p>for some of the couples i work with in my practice, i find that helping to organize a time apart, which i call a ""therapeutic separation"" can do wonders for the relationship. i offer homework to be done during this time. reading, worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship. it often times brings more appreciation for their partners. when the pair comes back together, we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before. <br></p>"

i need help knowing how to deal with stress. what can i do?,"our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that i find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. so that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. check out meditation apps such as 'breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. i recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard."
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.,"<p>sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? if you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. so people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""how could i do that?"", ""i looked so stupid!"" ""now people saw things i did not want them to see!"" if we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. these are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. if you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" we all make mistakes"", ""people can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""if someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really ok! people have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.<br></p>"

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy. therapy can be a rewarding process, however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies. i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind &amp; body connection. i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that. it would be helpful to explore the feelings you're having &nbsp;with your therapist. it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy.&nbsp;</p>"
"i terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. i am now realizing that i would like to begin counseling again.  the social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. i called him on the weekend and made it clear that i want him to call me back.  can he just ignore me?","mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients.&nbsp; this is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller.&nbsp; in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.<br><br>in addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards.&nbsp; for example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.<br><br>all that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.<br><br>in the end, i agree with sherry's advice. if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit.<br>"

his insecurities are hurting our relationship. how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","this suffering and clinging to the past, especially a troubled past or a past that we dont like, may be&nbsp; amplified due to the christian framework that may be built into your life. i am not averse to religion, i just think that many times it puts unreasonable expectations on us and helps us to form a guilt complex or perhaps even insecurities, we are humans and humans make mistakes. you mention the straight and narrow, this is a notion that you must give up on and let go, humans can never travel the straight and narrow for their whole lives there are bounds to be mistakes, we are the most fallible species on the planet and please tell your fiance to have some mercy on himself, he is not perfect. here is a story about clinging on to things you may find useful to mediate on:<br><br><b><font face=""papyrus""><font size=""+3"">o</font><font size=""+1"">nce
there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river. the current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and
old, rich and poor, good and evil -- the current going its own way, knowing
only its own crystal self.</font></font></b>
<p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging
was their way of life, and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth.</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">but one creature said
at last, ""i am tired of clinging. though i cannot see it with my eyes,
i trust that the current knows where it is going. i shall let go, and let
it take me where it will. clinging, i shall die of boredom.""</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">the other creatures laughed
and said, ""fool! let go, and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom!""</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">but the one heeded them
not, and taking a breath did let go, and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks.</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">yet in time, as the creature
refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from the bottom, and
he was bruised and hurt no more.</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">and the creatures downstream,
to whom he was a stranger, cried, ""see a miracle! a creature like ourselves,
yet he flies! see the messiah, come to save us all!""</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">and the one carried in
the current said, ""i am no more messiah than you. the river delights to
lift us free, if only we dare let go. our true work is this voyage, this
adventure.""</font></b></font>
</p><p><font size=""+1""><b><font face=""papyrus"">but they cried the more,
""savior!"" all the while clinging to the rocks, and when they looked again
he was gone, and they were left alone making legends of a savior.</font></b></font>

i truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. he's a great guy! i just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. he's starting to put less effort in talking to me.
at this point i'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. i tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. advice on what to do?","<p>i'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but i'd suggest giving him space. ooph, that's a tough one, right?! i know. but here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. he needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. it's the work of being in relationship to learn this. i get that this is tough stuff. i wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? that's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.</p>"

"i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. i have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. can counseling help?","<p>certainly counselling can help. however, there is a caveat, namely, you will need the right counsellor with the right approach. this leads to two questions: 1) what are the identifiers for the right counsellor, and 2) what is the right approach?</p><p>1) what are the identifiers for the right counsellor? the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. he or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. this person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. he or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. the in-depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. it goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. as well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' <br></p><p>2) what is the right approach?&nbsp; as carl jung stated, ""when the doctor sits down with the patient he (or 
she) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person."" the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to pre-verbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development.</p><p>depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. anxiety is not the problem. it is a sign that there is a problem. the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage.<br></p>"
"when i'm around people, i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something. i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me. i never know if it was actually said.","<p>it sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you, or if you only thought someone was talking to you, and this is anxiety producing. it's understandable that it could be confusing and/or a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not. it's hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description, but if you can work with a competent therapist, you may be able to get more insight into what is happening, get clarity about your social interactions, and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety.<br></p>"

since starting this diuretic medication i am peeing all the time.  i’m worried something’s wrong. is this normal?,"you've found that the new medication causes you to pee more than usual, which is causing some concern.  now that you've started a diuretic medication, you find yourself running to the bathroom way more than you used to. if you'd like, i can share more about why that's happening.  you pee more than you used to. the whole point of taking a diuretic is to increase urination. didn't you know that? that's what's supposed to happen. it's supposed to clean you out. this depends on the prescription and the side effects that have been experienced. have you spoken to your gp about this?"
"i eat at wendy’s a few times a week. it’s cheap, it’s fast, and it’s better than those other places. there’s a lot worse i could be eating. my parents don’t buy healthy foods, and i don’t have the money to buy them.","because there aren’t a lot of healthy foods in your house and money is tight, it makes it hard to eat better. so fast food is one of your only options. however, you care about your health and are starting to think about eating better than fast food. ideally you would prefer not to be eating as much at fast food. you want to eat healthy foods but struggle figuring out how to make it happen since your parents don't buy fruits and vegetables when they grocery shop.  
 your parents don't buy healthy foods when they grocery shop. you know, wendy’s is no better than mcdonald’s, so you are not doing yourself any favors by eating there.  it’s also more expensive than you think. don’t blame your parents why are you still getting fast food? i would recommend exercising more until you can afford to buy healthier foods. there's a lot of cheap and tasty things you can get at the grocery store to get more bang for your buck than wendy's. i know it's tasty but your body will thank you if you start meal prepping a better way. talk to your parents, and this will make everyone's diet more balanced."

we're in an eight year relationship. my boyfriend drinks a lot. he experienced childhood trauma. i don't know how to deal with violent outbursts.,"<p>first, let me extend my compassion to both of you -- it sounds like you have a lot on your plates. childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us.&nbsp;</p><p>your question is brief, so i'll just try to give general answers as best i can. from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriend's experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you can't fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. he needs a professional. period.&nbsp;</p><p>what you <span style=""font-style: italic;"">can</span>&nbsp;do, is take care of yourself. with his background, it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, manage his own emotions and behaviors. so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the near-term, certainly not without professional help. you might also benefit from help and support, to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriend's behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. if you have accepted your boyfriend's drinking and violent outbursts in the past (by staying in the relationship), that is likely to perpetuate his behavior. and there isn't any way to ""handle violent outbursts."" they shouldn't be handled at all, and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>we can never really change anyone else. the only person we can change is ourselves. sometimes our behavior changes the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">odds</span> of another person's behaviors, but it doesn't control it. i would recommend that you work with a professional to first, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ensure your own safety above all</span>. then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and which you want to separate from. whatever your boyfriend does in his life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey.&nbsp;</p><p>wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery.&nbsp;</p>"

"for the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. i'm at my wits end. how can i get them to stop and get along?","<p>that is a good question. unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them.&nbsp;</p><p>these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is ""active listening"" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. if this doesn't work it may be time to get a <a href=""https://nat-roman.squarespace.com/config#/pages|/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy/couples-therapy-marriage-counselling"">family therapist </a>or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict.&nbsp;</p>"

"a few years ago i was making love to my wife when for no known reason i lost my erection, 

now i'm in my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent.  this is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. this has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. 

i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. i am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like i used to. 

what could be causing this, and what can i do about it?","when i'm working with men with this type of situation, i always suggest a medical examination to rule out any type of organic reason for a difficulty in maintaining interaction. in cases where there is no medical reason for the loss of erection, i find that many men have a similar situation in experiencing negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking. my counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex."

i heard from my friend that you can get the covid from the vaccine.,"you feel confused about the efficacy or benefits of the vaccine. it makes you question whether or not getting the vaccine is the right choice for you. you are nervous about receiving the vaccine because of what you've heard about people getting sick after. you think you can get covid from the vaccine. that's just a rumor anti-vaxxers spread. aren't you worried you might die from covid if you don't get the vaccine? have you read information from the cdc about the vaccine? i think that would be helpful, to get the facts from a scientific point of view. trust health professionals not by what others say. since the vaccine doesn't contain any virus in it, that is probably not likely."

"she treats me like i'm not in her presence. she’s always yelling at me for no reason. she gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while i respect her.","<p>attention is not equal to love and being valued. it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your mom's attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them. it is a common situation in families where the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" and the siblings or family members who don't demand as much attention end up feeling invisible. it sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you. &nbsp;this sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some <a href=""http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy/family-therapy-counselling/"">family therapy</a> where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out.&nbsp;</p>"
"it was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because i have started seeing her facebook posts about how great her life is. i feel so angry. how can i handle this?","<p>emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.</p><p>you were betrayed by two people close to you. that's a complex injury. i don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity.&nbsp;</p><p>i'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? i guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. if you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>so your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""she doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""she doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""she doesn't care that i'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). where does your mind go? it's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her.&nbsp;</p><p>when you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""what evidence supports that thought as truth?"" it's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.</p><p>a therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. it doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"". it's about saying ""it happened. i accept that i can't change it, and i don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". forgiveness is putting it down. she... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. for you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. it only adds to yours.&nbsp;</p><p>can you find the tender emotion under your anger? you're hurt. validate that hurt. honour that hurt. take care of that hurt. you can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>if you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)</p>"
how can i get to a place where i can be content from day to day?,"<p>one thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day. it could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are, but because so many other things are going on, you may not notice.</p><p>another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day. this way, when you're having a rough day, you have a list to think of and take a look at.</p><p>are you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you (typically at least two meals per day and roughly 8 hours of sleep that night (may be different depending on your age)? these two ideas are closely related to changes in your mood.</p><p>from where do you have support? friends or family?</p><p>can you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoy?</p><p>if you think back to the last time that you felt ""content,"" what was contributing to that?</p><p>another possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day. for example, rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break, consider actually tasting it and enjoying it. also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well. for example, when you finish your paperwork, take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your e-mail, reading five pages of a book, or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task.</p>"
nothing we've tried has worked so far.,"<p>sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum. if you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend, you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy. you could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable. after doing this for nonsexual touching, it can also be used with sexual touching. looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help.</p>"
"i have an ex-boyfriend who just lies about everything. he is super lazy. he lies to everyone that he has a good job, builds trust, and then start borrowing money—and large amounts too. it has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends. he is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story, borrow money, then disappear. he refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends. i used to think his lying was due to his drug habit, but now i'm hearing from other ex-friends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life. he would borrow anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 from everyone and it would all disappear. he's in debt with bills. he doesn't gamble, but he spends his money on random stuff.

although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money, he seems to be a good person. he'll always give a homeless person all his change no matter what. my brother has epilepsy and is really antisocial—my ex-boyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother. he takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him. he drives me to school and work every day and picks me up—just basically the small things that add up to the fact that he's not totally a horrible human being. is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there?","<p>it sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your ex-boyfriend that are difficult to sort out. you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him, and this is true of everyone to one degree or another. one question that i would have for you is, are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands? are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you, or would you like them to be different? negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist. another question i would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior? discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him.<br></p>"

"i'm depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. after a bit, i start noticing that i am picking at my skin profusely. after roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. sometimes i find myself causing fights to have change.","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. i am very sorry that you are struggling. i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. <br></p><p>depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. this means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. <br></p><p>as you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. when they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. <br></p><p>skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. these are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. that is a very normal thing to do. nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. <br></p><p>the problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. in fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. <br></p><p>depression and anxiety can&nbsp; be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. i would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. medication can be helpful, but i still recommend counseling. the reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. <br></p><p>be well,</p><p>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc <br></p>"
does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"<p>yes, counseling provides an area for people to speak to an unbiased professional about their concerns to address their unique needs. while length of time varies, counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions. counseling provide a safe, non-judgmental, empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service&nbsp;</p>"
"i've felt this way for  two years. i feel so much better now then i did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.","<p>best answer that i can give to you is that some level of de-personalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a roller-coaster, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""here it is, then it's gone not to return for quite some time"", </span>like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about. <br></p><p>hope this helps,</p><p>c<br></p>"
"i’m trying to make marriage work after a split. before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. i don't think he cheated. last month, i asked what women work with him, so he told me. yesterday, i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. should i be upset?","<p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family:&quot;helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about?&nbsp; think about it for a minute.&nbsp; do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female co-workers your husband has?&nbsp; and if so, what does that say about your marriage? &nbsp;trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with; it’s also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family:&quot;helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">if you are focused on every little detail around your relationship, it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more. &nbsp;&nbsp;if instead you focus on opening the lines of communication, let him know what you expect from him, and discuss how you could both build trust again, you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family:&quot;helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><span style=""color: rgb(46, 116, 181); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17pt; line-height: 107%;"">¿debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevo?</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""color: rgb(59, 56, 56); font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.42857;"">estoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación.&nbsp; antes de separarnos el mentía mucho y rompía todas sus promesas.&nbsp; no creo que me haya sido infiel.&nbsp; el mes pasado, le pregunté cuantas mujeres trabajan con él, y él me dijo.&nbsp; ayer, me enteré que se olvido de una muchacha.&nbsp; ¿debería estar enojada?</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.42857;"">¿quieres estar molesta porque se le olvido con cuantas mujeres trabaja?&nbsp; piénsalo por un momento.&nbsp; ¿quieres determinar la confianza que le tienes en tu esposo basándote en su capacidad de reportar la cantidad de mujeres que trabajan con él?&nbsp; si tu respuesta es sí, ¿qué refleja eso sobre tu matrimonio?&nbsp; la confianza es algo que se gana basado en nuestras acciones y las de aquellos con quienes interactuamos; también en nuestra habilidad de comunicar y entender los valores que tenemos en común.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.42857;"">si practicas estar preocupada por cada pequeño detalle en tu relación, esto se puede convertir en una obsesión que potencialmente dañara tu relación. &nbsp;si en cambio te enfocas en abrir las líneas de comunicación, le dejas saber lo que esperas de él y discuten cómo pueden trabajar juntos para recuperar la confianza, pueden volverse más cercanos y darse la oportunidad de que la relación crezca.</span></p>"

"i feel that i am struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and it is making my day-to-day life extremely difficult.","it sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of distress and you're wondering if it may meet a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. there are a few different types of bipolar diagnoses in the dsm (diagnositc and statistical manual) and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional. you can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteria.<br><br>one question that i would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out that you meet the criteria for such a diagnosis? it sounds like whether or not you do, you are suffering and working with a therapist may help you get into a better place.<br>"
"i'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? it can take some work, but healing is possible. if you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. let him know what some helpful responses may be.&nbsp;"
"i believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. he masturbates daily, even when i am lying in bed sleeping beside him. we have sex once a week. he is rough and worries about his needs. he never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","<p>it sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, i am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. one thing you need to ask yourself is ""am i happy?"", ""do i feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. <br></p>"
"i’m in a relationship with my child's father. i’m a really jealous person. we don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. to keep our relationship going, i know i have to stop being jealous, but i can’t. how can i get over these issues?","<p>it may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than ""getting over it."" if you're aware of the reasons why you are jealous, i don't know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.</p><p>also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your child's father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.</p><p>also, consider what you may want from your child's father to assist you with this. you cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.</p><p>what is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?</p>"
"whether it's to a guy or girl, i always feel insecure talking, and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. even when i am walking, i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","i want to add that one way therapy can help with social anxiety is to give you a corrective experience. &nbsp;each week, you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you, who doesn't judge you, and who you can voice your concerns to. &nbsp;over time, you show them more and more of yourself, and as they get to know you, they still care about you, they still don't judge you, and they still think you are amazing. &nbsp;find a therapist you connect with."
"i panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. it was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, i left a note with an illegible phone number. guilty over this, i got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. unfortunately, by the time i returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. since i cannot make this up to that individual, how do i atone for my cowardly act? i have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out.","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;thanks for sharing as it shows your humanity and that you have a sensitive conscience. in your example here i'd encourage you to always think, ""safety first""; and never offer a stranger at the accident scene ""...several hundred dollars"". why? because it could go badly against you (i.e. extortion, robbed, or would this be considered a bribe).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;to the point, i'm reminded of steps eight and nine in many 12-step programs regarding making amends. in your specific example since the injured unidentified party departed, and by your own admission you've been doing random acts of kindness, it seems to me you've acted in reasonable good faith fashion to make amends. well done.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;i'm not a karma expert but as a therapist i would invite you to explore the deeper story behind your use of the words ""cowardly"", ""guilty"", and what it does for you to engage in ""random acts of kindness"". what a fascinating journey this could be for you. best wishes.</p>"
"my boyfriend  and i have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like i could never find someone better, and that i can't be happy without him.

how do i get away from this relationship?","<p>i'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.</p><p>one of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.</p><p>this happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. &nbsp;regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.</p><p>stick with what your own intuition tells you.</p><p>there is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.</p><p>leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. &nbsp;people are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly ""be alone"", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.</p><p>these are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.</p><p>listen to yourself about leaving this guy. your inner self does not lie to you.</p>"

</p><p class=""msonormal"">i see a few issues here:</p><p class=""msonormal"">first, the age of the child is important.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>if the child is considered an
""adult"" by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this
- the range is typically between age 13 and age 18), no one is allowed to
be in the session without the child's consent.</p><p class=""msonormal"">second, ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, but
not both.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a child.<br></p><p class=""msonormal"">third, knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;
</span>generally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the child’s sessions.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;
</span>if a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child’s
sessions.<br></p>in a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law.

"i've never been able to talk with my parents. my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager. i love both of them but not their personalities. i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life. if my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. i’m a pansexual, but i can’t trust my own parents.
i've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. i feel that my friends don't listen to me. i know they have their own problems, which i do my best to help with. but they don't always try to help me with mine, when i really need them. i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust.","<p>teenage years are rough for anyone, and this is a time for self-discovery and experimentation. having older parents can certainly pose challenges. most kids feel like their parents don't understand them, but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers. they're from a completely different generation than you are. it sounds like they love you, but may not understand you. the problem here is the generation/age gap, and there's not a whole lot you can do about that. what you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently. it seems like you're looking for affirmation from them, looking for their approval and understanding. it's never a good idea to look to others to define who you are or to get a self-esteem boost. who you are and how you feel about yourself needs to come from inside, not from outside. one way you can have a better relationship with your parents is to stop looking at all the things you aren't getting from them that you want, and rather look at all the things you are getting from them. yes, this is a glass half full or half empty point of view, but it works. the negative will overshadow the positive if you let it. start looking for the good things in your relationship with your parents and your feelings towards them will become more positive.</p><p>i'm not sure how your friends/peers made you feel like your childhood has been taken from you. that's a curious statement, and requires a deeper conversation to understand where that came from. however, i do understand feeling different and out of place, especially in high school. find the strength within yourself rather than looking to others in your life to make you feel better or feel like a complete person. it helps to have friends and loved ones, but you can never rely on them to fulfill all of your needs. set some goals for your future, work towards them. focus on being the best you that you can be, and the right people will enter your life at the right time.&nbsp;</p>"
"something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for. when i think about what happened, i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","<p>forgiveness takes time. you know what you did, and by the sounds of it you are not impressed with yourself. in my mind, this is a sign that you are a good person. you recognize that you did something that crossed your own moral code. you could have just done this thing and not felt anything - but you do feel. and that is ok. it's not supposed to feel good when you do something wrong.<br><br>be patient with yourself. these things can take time. i suspect that you will be one of those people who slowly let go of their shame and guilt. the trick is to feel the pain but to not ignore/detach from the life that you are living right now. don't deprive yourself of the opportunity to feel joy again.&nbsp;</p>"
she is living with her boyfriend of seven years. he is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. he hasn't worked in all this time.,"<p>congrats on your upcoming grandchild!</p><p><span style=""-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">does your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy, to the family?</span><br></p><p>talk with your daughter first, whether or not she would like you to tell other family members.</p><p>also, given the other facts you mention in your post, if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable, then bring up these topics too.</p><p>stay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours.</p>"
"my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. we've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. i don't know how to trust him now, but i really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","<p>hi michigan,</p><p>this is a common issue. how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? i totally get that it's hard, and i believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. you can be stronger in the scarred places.&nbsp;</p><p>i would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. it is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.</p><p>your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. he chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. you can use that as evidence in your ""proof that he loves me"" file. work on that file...thicken it up. having a thick ""he does care about me and wouldn't hurt me again"" file will help you.&nbsp;</p><p>other things that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">he</span> can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don't brush you off if you're feeling insecure, treat you as though you're a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. he can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren't always good with those 'why' questions!)</p><p>you can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you've decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. if you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. don't go snooping, don't interrogate him. it's normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.</p><p>this is a start for you. a good therapist can be helpful too!</p>"
"my therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. however, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. i have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back.

i had a medical emergency last weekend and i was heavily medicated. i knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.  i don't know what to do.","<p>i'm sorry to hear that this has&nbsp;happened.&nbsp;counselors are legally&nbsp;and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests.&nbsp;in addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of&nbsp;a client financially.&nbsp;a counselor borrowing money from a client (even if the counselor&nbsp;pays it back) would&nbsp;usually be considered to be taking advantage of the client.</p><p>there are a few options you have at this point if&nbsp;you can't (or don't want) to continue to try to contact him directly. you can file a complaint with your states' regulatory board and let them&nbsp;know what has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;an investigator will then look into the situation for you.&nbsp; another option would be for you to find a different counsleor who can provide you with an independent and netural point of view to help you figure out how you want to handle this situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>"
"i probably should start using condoms with my boyfriend, he slept with someone and gave me an sti.  i haven’t brought it up with him. i don’t want him to think i don’t trust him. ","you don’t want a repeat sti so you’re starting to consider using condoms from now on. you're not sure the best way to approach the sti with your boyfriend. on one hand, you don't want to cause conflict and make him think you don't trust him, but on the other hand, you know that using condoms now on is the best plan.  after getting a sti from your boyfriend, you want to start using condoms regularly.  your boyfriend's behavior indicates you should not trust him, so it's ok to give him that message. you need to protect your health because it's clear he isn't going to protect you. why do you trust him after he slept with someone else? in any relationship it is important to be open and honest, especially when it comes to reproductive health. you owe it to yourself to be healthy and take precautions. some sti's such as hiv can be forever life altering and it's import to be safe. this is not something that you need to keep from him. he violated your trust and introduced a disease to you. condoms would be the last thing i would be worried about if i were him. do talk to him, because he is a person of your affection."
what? she told you she did not smoke for several months? she just smoked yesterday. she won’t stop smoking.,"your wife’s story is inconsistent. you wonder why she may be saying one thing but doing another. you're confused to hear that your wife's story is different. you saw her smoke yesterday. thank you for telling me. i'm glad someone was honest. how can you make sure she doesn't keep lying? this is an addiction that can and should be treated, but it also depends on the person's goodwill. addiction is a problem you have to try to create a physical activity routine to supply that endorphin craving. thats a pity that she felt like she couldnt tell me the truth"
"i found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. we've only been dating 3 weeks but i like him a lot.","<p>your boyfriend may like you a lot as well.</p><p>people have different styles of reflecting on their lives, one of which is to retreat the way you describe your boyfriend doing.</p><p>one point you can consider is asking for a time frame of when he'd be ready to discuss his thoughts on your relationship.</p><p>he's entitled to retreat, as much as you're entitled to talk.</p><p>cooperating with the other person's way of handling themselves is one aspect of relating.</p><p>since the anti-depressants are a concern for you, consider bringing up this topic when the two of you do talk.</p>"
i feel like i have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? it started after i got raped by my ex-boyfriend.,"<p>i recommend that you seek professional services to address the trauma you experienced. emdr has been proven to be very effective in treating trauma. in addition, a support group might be helpful to find a more stable support network. either a support group for victims of rape or sex/love addiction <a href=""http://www.sa.org"">www.sa.org</a> sound appropriate. whichever group resonates the most with you will be the most helpful. </p><p>if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.</p>"
my daughter is so overweight. i think we should get her that stomach surgery.,"you're starting to think of ways that you may be able to help your daughter lose some weight. you are nervous that if your daughter continues on the path she's on now, she's going to be overweight, which might negatively impact her life.  your daughter's weight scares you. you're ready to have her weight problem behind you. i can send you a referral to surgery. what else have you tried besides surgery? let's try a strict diet before stomach surgery. stomach surgery should be the last option. before that, consult a specialist doctor and there are other ways such as good nutrition or even physical activities. i think you should give your daughter a chance to lose weight via diet and exercise before you get her stomach syrgery."
"over the years, i have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. i am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","<p>there are an infinite number of possibilities here. you included a lot of things that you don't have. is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. i don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.</p><p>i wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. i don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? if you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.</p><p>also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. for example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.</p>"
i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,<p>it is absolutely a typical response.&nbsp; many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.&nbsp; this is&nbsp;essentially a stranger&nbsp;with whom&nbsp;you are sharing&nbsp;your&nbsp;feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
"people who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. it makes me feel like i'm not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. i have had jobs, but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. any time i bring these things up, i am expected to be over the issue. these are people that you can't just cut out, but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain. i don't know what to do any more. i don't know who i am anymore.","<p>hello. adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. we carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. this is often easier said than done, but it is possible. from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed.&nbsp;</p><p>those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. they themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. how are they behaving toward you now? can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. by forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.<br></p><p>warm regards,</p><p>shawn berthel, m.s., lmhc<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
"she said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. i still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.","<p>it sounds as if your ex-girlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you. there are lots of levels of relationships, from a basic acquaintance, to a more friendly acquaintance, to a friend, close friend, best friend, early romantic partner, committed romantic partner, and many more.</p><p>if she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings, it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but are what are called open-ended questions, which ask her to provide more information. during this process, it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal, but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective. after you have done this for five minutes (it's a rough estimate, but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right), you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling. the goal is not necessarily to change the outcome, but to learn more about yourselves and each other.</p><p>then you may have an idea of where you stand in each other's eyes.</p>"
"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and i just had my first kiss five months ago. i’m worried that, at this rate, i won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, i don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. i feel dirty by doing this, but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking. i am tall, i play lots of sports, and i get excellent grades in school. i am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. it bothers me. most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. i feel like i will be single forever sometimes.","i think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. it is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. we fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>there is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what i mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>when you are most <a href=""http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/articles/hope-in-the-midst-of-hopelessness"">afraid of being alone </a>- remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>"
"i feel very agitated when i try to quit smoking.  also, the doctor told me, if things get rough, instead of being depressive or anxious, i can light up a cigarette, have three puffs and then discard it. so, i have reduced smoking, but i cannot quit completely. i sometimes still smoke a quarter of a cigarette to keep myself calm.","you’ve worked hard to cut down on the number of cigarettes you smoke. you’re finding that the thought of quitting is upsetting so you’ve found a way to cut back without quitting completely. your smoking feels a bit out of control. you want to quit, you put a lot of effort in, but the messages you're receiving about having just a couple puffs feel like they're setting you back a bit -- almost like a loophold that makes it ok to keep smoking.  you've find yourself feeling anxious and depressed when you try to quit. have you considered finding other coping mechanisms like deep breathing or journaling? a doctor told you it's ok to smoke?? i know what the doctor told you, do you think you have to discipline in order to just have three puffs? wanting to quit smoking is up to you and know that this is a risk to your health. can you think of anything you could do to replace it? chewing on gum, having a sip of diet soda, or going for a quick walk?"
what should i do when we see each other?,<p>i am so sorry this happened. &nbsp;sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful. &nbsp;i might suggest (depending on your relationship) reaching out to your sister and discussing this (or setting boundary that you don't want to discuss your private life). &nbsp;i might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal. &nbsp;</p>

"i am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. they are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house.
is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way? this is not a joke. i am trying to understand.","<p>hi,&nbsp;</p><p>this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem - good for you for reaching out! my first thought is, these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places. since they are adults, and you can't force them to seek treatment, &nbsp;you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider. . as far as what to do for yourself - set some firm boundaries. be clear about the expectations of your home. also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue. i hope this helps you, your family members, and the pets!</p>"
"my wife and i have a great relationship except for our sex lives. we are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. she doesn't have the desire. she's also never orgasmed. she feels like a terrible wife and fears i'll cheat on her. she doesn't know why. last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. however, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. that makes me feel really awful. we rarely have foreplay. everything i try tickles her, so she makes me stop. we are both frustrated but very much in love. she and i are in our early 20s. we’re married and we have a baby on the way.","<p>congrats on your upcoming baby!</p><p>its possible that the pregnancy is diminishing your wife's sex drive.</p><p>from everything you describe about your wife, she sounds to not yet have become comfortable with having a wish for sex.</p><p>the other side of the sex equation is you and your relative ease with having sex and whether it is for physical release or as an expression of love, some of each.</p><p>since you talk with each other honestly then start with a dialogue about what you each would like from sex with each other, from perspective of giving and receiving sex. &nbsp;hopefully this will open up some new light on your respective feelings.</p><p>really, there is a lot to navigate in a conversation about physical and emotional intimacy. &nbsp;</p><p>if these are not the types of discussions the two of you are used to having, a couples therapist is a good idea so you both become familiar and learn how to more easily articulate some of your respective deep feelings.</p><p><br></p>"
"i self-harm, and i stop for awhile. then when i see something sad or depressing, i automatically want to self-harm.","<p>in a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. &nbsp;according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. &nbsp;when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. &nbsp;if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. &nbsp;another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. &nbsp;</p><p>consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior. &nbsp; someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy and/or interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you.&nbsp;</p>"
i'm  very depressed. how do i find someone to talk to?,"<p>hang in there! feeling depressed sucks but talking with someone can really help - so its awesome that you're already trying to figure out how to find that person. tons of good suggestions already but to add my two cents - you can find therapists in your area and read a little bit about them to find someone you like the sound of via this website, and also via www.psychologytoday.com; if you have health insurance your insurer might be able to make recommendations as to therapists covered by your plan, or if you happen to be in school, the school itself should be able to connect you with either their own counselor or a center that they recommend nearby. finding someone can take a few calls or a bit of research so if you need some immediate support, or find yourself having thoughts of hurting yourself, you can also call the great folks who run the suicide crisis line&nbsp;https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org - they are great in moments of crisis.</p>"
she is living with her boyfriend of seven years. he is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. he hasn't worked in all this time.,"<p>hi new york, there is no need for shame here; no one's done anything wrong! a pregnancy is a glorious gift to be celebrated.&nbsp;</p><p>i wonder what gets in the way of you celebrating your daughter's pregnancy?&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">are they excited about it? i bet they are. they've been together for seven years. even if it caught them off guard, the best thing for them and this new baby is to celebrate the joy of this new little person and their growing family. if you are happy for them and help spread their joy, how marvelous would that be for them as a family?</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">new york, i will be honest with you; i hope that's okay. i sense that maybe you are feeling judgemental towards them. do you dislike or judge his struggle with mental illness? do you see him as less than worthy because he hasn't worked? i don't know for sure, but i imagine maybe his anxiety and depression get in the way of working. maybe he's on a social disability? mental illness doesn't make someone less lovable or valuable as a partner. he's getting help for himself and that's wonderful.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">if your daughter loves him and is happy with him... if he is her chosen man, then they absolutely need your support, not your judgement. and if they struggle as a couple, you know what...they will need it even more!</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 20px;"">is this your first grandchild? if not, then i don't have to say this, but if it is...you are in for the most amazing adventure of your lifetime. you will fall in love so deeply with this child. s/he needs that...this baby needs your love and support.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">so, you say to your family...

he is in his late thirties and i am in my mid twenties. we have been together for about 5 months. i really like him. he says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right. he has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear. i don't know if it's worth giving him a second chance.,"<p>cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship. his fear may be full of information. while it's possible to repair relationships after a betrayal it's also challenging to do, especially so early in your relationship. i can't tell you if you should/shouldn't give this relationship a second chance but i will tell you to tune into your own intuition (and follow your own fears in doing so, they often are incredibly informative when we don't push them away with denial).</p>"
"i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","<p>something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.&nbsp;</p><p>some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first i'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. &nbsp;combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>if you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then i'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. this professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.</p>"

"these meds aren’t helping me.  i don’t feel any different.  i thought these were supposed to help me feel better. i try to remember to take them everyday, but i don’t feel them working. what’s the point in swallowing those pills if they don’t work?","so, feeling better is important to you and you are wondering why you keep taking the meds when you can't tell that they're working. you wish that the meds made you feel better. you had high hopes that these meds might be what you needed and you're feeling disappointing that it doesn't seem to be working out that way. your meds don't cause you to feel any different. take your medications as prescribed and you'll see that they'll work for you. are you taking them as prescribed? they might be working even if you don't notice any changes. you could look into other meds if you're confident that they're not working. the medicines have long-term effects, little by little you will not even notice that you are getting better, be patient. you must tell them directly then only they can understand and change their behaviour"

how does a person start the counseling process?,"<p>approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first, but most mental health professionals want to help you feel safe and heard. &nbsp;you can often find counselors using search engines like counselchat or psychology today. &nbsp;these websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step. &nbsp;these days, counselors have websites where you can learn even more. &nbsp;these websites usually have clear instructions for contact. &nbsp;typically, you can reach out via phone or email to request a consultation. &nbsp;during a consultation call, you can ask the therapist questions about their credentials and areas of expertise. &nbsp;if you feel like you connect, you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy. &nbsp;the thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them, and they are happy to be approached for support. &nbsp;good luck! &nbsp;</p>"

how can i know if i'm just being paranoid?,"<p>hi texas,</p><p>oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? it burrows into your head. let's figure this out. first, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? have they cheated before? if not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. if it's a ""yes"", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. ""when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that you're hiding something. i need openness"". if they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. what is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? when you have your data recorded, read on...</p><p>the first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). this may be true if what you wrote down is ""they didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. i'm just scared and suspicious"". that's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. i can trust.""</p><p>if what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.</p><p>the third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. i'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. if this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you.&nbsp;</p><p>i hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>"

our chew is more natural than that stuff you buy in the store.  at least i know where it comes from.  no artificial chemicals.,"finding a natural, chemical free way to decompress is important to you.  when compared to some of the other things you could be using, natural chew seems like a healthier choice.  you pick a check without artifical chemicals. you're kidding yourself if you think that's better for you. can you think of another way to cope besides chew? if you're confident that it will not result in any long-term conditions, then i can't tell you not to use it, but don't tell me i didn't warn you. but you should consume good things that are good and not just because it is natural. what about it is more natural? why do you think this makes it safe to use?"

"i just love sweets. cookies, candy, ice cream, you name it.  and i know it is making me fat.  i actually like fruit but my mom never buys any. she says they are really expensive and nobody eats them.","while you know that the sweets you enjoy may have played a role in your weight gain, you’ve also found that there are healthy alternatives you really enjoy. you’d eat fruit more often if you could find a way to get your hands on more. you think the sweets and treats you've been eating have caused you to gain weight. maybe you weren't ready to eat fruit before when mom was buying it. i think you can tell her you want to try again and this time she can forgo buying all of the sweets you want to avoid and then you won't have a choice but to eat the fruit. why didn't you eat the fruit your mom bought before? do not be so hard on yourself, you can have a cheat day where you eat one or two bars of candy in a week. and then use the money you have saved from not eating sweets to buying some fruits you love. i think you should try to have a serious conversation with your mom. listen to her concerns, and also make your needs heard. i know it's hard when you aren't making the purchasing decisions. can you go grocery shopping with your mom and work together on healthier choices?"

"i feel insecure in my life. i don't think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. i have had a drinking problem for a few years. i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to, but because i have lately been on edge. i’ve been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years. i’m paranoid about driving on main roads. i’m very jumpy at the slightest noises.","<p>given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. &nbsp;first and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. &nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">there are however, ways to address this. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">as for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model (dbt) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. &nbsp;mindfulness, another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. &nbsp;there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. &nbsp;well worth looking into.</span></p><p>seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist. &nbsp;this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away. &nbsp;think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound. &nbsp;the same applies here. &nbsp;think of it as first aid for the mind.&nbsp;</p>"

"i'm planning to have baby, so i have to quit smoking - but it's hard. sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. what can i do to get rid of this addiction?","<p>breaking any habit is no easy feat. &nbsp; cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging, and there aren't any one size fits all solutions. &nbsp;fortunately, there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking. &nbsp;1. many habits that we have are paired habits. if we do one thing, then we will do the other thing. &nbsp;think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking. &nbsp;for instance, many people smoke while they drive. &nbsp;consider planning another activity to do while driving. (it might not be driving for you, but you get the idea! :)). &nbsp;it might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work. &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break. &nbsp;this approach could be used in a variety of different ways. &nbsp;if you smoke first thing in the morning, consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home. &nbsp;walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke. &nbsp; leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes. &nbsp;with this strategy, you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them. &nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;consider cutting back before cutting out. &nbsp;if you are smoking 10 cigarettes a day, try smoking 9. then cut back to 8 and so on. &nbsp;having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>4. &nbsp;you could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches. if you aren't already pregnant, this could be a great resource to help boost your success. &nbsp;</p><p>5. focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing. you may be losing cigarettes,&nbsp;but you are gaining money, health, taste buds, an increased sense of smell, lung capacity, a healthy baby etc. &nbsp;you could plan small rewards/ treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases. &nbsp;i recommend&nbsp;making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>good luck! cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby. &nbsp;</p>"

"i’ve known my boyfriend for several years. we were friends for a long time. in 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state. i planned to move in with him in 2014 after i finished school and he found a job. however, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. we decided later to make it work. shortly after, i found out that i was pregnant. i wanted to tell him during his next visit. however, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. after i gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. 

soon after, i experienced a miscarriage. i texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. i was extremely hurt by this. i still decided to move back as i had originally planned. he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him. during this time, i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know. although he says he did, i hardly ever see him. he never got a job, which was in the original plan.  

after that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. once we got back together, i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in. i thought he had too. but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman. in fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. when i confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. i don’t know what to do.","<ol></ol><p>there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with:</p><ol><li>several breakups </li><li><span>not holding up his end of the bargain regarding work</span></li><li><span>lack of empathy for your miscarriage</span></li><li><span>lying about his involvement with another woman</span></li><li><span>physical violence, which is of most concern. </span></li></ol><p>this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. in my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, “is this really someone i want to marry? is he an asset to my life?” i think you’ll realize he is not.</p><p>best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect.</p>"

face consequences sometimes if we don't ""fit in"" the way others tell
us to. even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong, we still internalize

"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.
the other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. 
i'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.","<p>hi los angeles,</p><p>so your husband is giving you mixed messages. he says he's willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. it sounds more like you're talking about an out-of-control teenager than your partner.&nbsp;</p><p>your husband's lying is sending a message. ""i get to make my own decisions and you can't stop me"" might be it. underneath that, maybe it's ""i want to stop but i'm ashamed that i can't and i don't want you to see my failures"". ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... &nbsp;</p><p>how does his drinking affect you? that's where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he's passed out, asking if he's been drinking seems confusing). you've mentioned snoring, which i guess is a legitimate complaint. if he's passing out, that's a legitimate complaint. when he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or 'check out of' the relationship (avoid you)? all of these things are legitimate concerns, and i'd stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. my guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. but the problem is it makes it worse; the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.</p><p>there's a conversation that would be helpful here. &nbsp;it sounds like ""i've tried to support you in your drinking less, and it's not working. what are your goals for alcohol and how can i support you in that more effectively?"" i'd like to see you in a place where you're not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. what concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? can we get the alcohol out of the house? is he willing to seek treatment?&nbsp;</p><p>lay your expectations out really clearly. ""i won't count your beers, but i can't tolerate lying"". you have to decide what's more important; is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. what do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? what does he need? does he let you know what isn't okay with him? he might have trouble saying these things.&nbsp;</p><p>the drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage. a qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart, understanding it, and changing the way you relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>"
"i was raped a couple months ago, since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, i have been having trouble feeling emotions. it's almost as if i'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. what can i do to change this?","<p>first and foremost, be gentle and patient with yourself. it is normal to feel a range of emotions after a severe trauma including no emotions at all. try not to push yourself to feel, just notice the lack of emotion you are experiencing right now. maybe write about your emotions and the lack of them or talk about it with a safe person. unfortunately recovering from trauma can take time and it's best done at your own pace. if you aren't feeling there may be a reason you aren't feeling. for severe trauma i always recommend working with a trained trauma professional who has the training to guide you on your path to healing fully.</p>"

"my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. the next day, she kicked me out.  she let me move back two days later. yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. i asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says it's not my business.","<p>when ""threats"" of leaving, such as what you described in your question (""kicking you out, wanting divorce"") are continuous in your marriage, it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship, impacting both partners. and, if you're concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship, and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife, it's extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>from the information provided in your question, it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship. avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship. if your wife is willing, i would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time. or, for you to talk with an individual therapist, if marriage counseling isn't an option. &nbsp;</p>"
"my boyfriend has this close female friend. it always bothered me because of how close they are, so i decided to meet her. that made the situation worse because they were even closer than what i thought. they acted like a couple rather than friends with each other. there was no physical interaction, but he talks to this girl a lot. what can i do? leaving him isn't an option.","<p>i wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling. a few things may help with that:</p><ul><li>try having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important (for example, not during a commercial for a tv show)</li><li>maybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience, kind of like an investigative reporter would</li><li>see if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what you're saying by summarizing it for you</li><li>remember that hearing you and following what you're saying does not mean that he agrees</li><li>also consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl (we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current ones)</li><li>then you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing (for example, what it is that he likes about her)</li><li>also consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion, discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame (usually between 15 minutes and one hour) and then come back to continue the discussion</li><li>remember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through, not to find a solution right away</li></ul><p>this can be difficult. consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together.</p>"
"my parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. when they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual. i don't know if i am ready to come out to them.","<p>coming out to family members can cause a lot of anxiety. however, &nbsp;although i cannot promise what their reaction will be, the benefit is that you will no longer have to hide who you are. perhaps researching or getting information on bisexuality can help your family understand what it truly is to be bisexual. many times, &nbsp;people are just not educated on certain things.&nbsp;</p>"
"i stopped using that advair, ( or other controller medication) it tastes bad and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, besides i got that other puffer, i heard that you can take that one as much as want, right?","it is difficult for you to take the medications when they don’t agree with you. so, if a different medication tasted better, you might be able to take it. you have an understanding of the differences between controller and rescue medications but you still have a handful of questions. if it's ok with you, i can tell you more... since you don't like the taste of advair, you're mostly using your rescue inhaler.  we've already reviewed how and when you should take your medications. take your medications as we discussed. you think you can take the rescue inhaler as much as you want? you shouldn't stop taking medication just because of the taste. the bad taste is temporary compared to your health. you should only take as much as indicated. yes, that is correct, but make sure you share these concerns with your pcp."

"i work two jobs and go to school for criminal justice. over the summer, my father had a stroke. it was very devastating. my father isn't the same, and my family fights every day. i have been kicked out the house many times. i break down a lot.","<p>you undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders. stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father, family conflict, as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule. stress, if left unchecked has many negative health related implications. first and foremost i would recommend going to see a counselor at your college/university. most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 5-6 free counseling sessions (your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them). secondly i would advise you to take a minute and breathe. when confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama, but sometimes that can compound our stress. when dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care. in other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace, enjoyment, and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life. even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress, it is inevitable and a part of life, but how you deal with stress, as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life. i hope this helps...<br></p>"
i go to the emergency room because the doctor refuses to give me more dilaudid.  she prescribes it only twice a day and it’s not helping me. she is telling me to drink 6-8 glasses of water every day as if that’ll take away the pain in my back and lower legs. he doesn’t know what people with sickle go through.  i need relief.,"you feel like the doctor isn't taking you seriously. you're complaining about debilitating pain and it feels like you're being ignored, especially when you're told to just drink water.  it makes you furious that you're not able to get enough medication. your meds aren't helping you. you are not being a very good patient. do what your doctor says and you'll be fine. did you try drinking the water? patience, only take medications that are indicated by the doctors. the pill is not the only solution to any disease.taking too many pills can be harmful to your body so eating  a healthy diet is good  for your body ask your doctor if the prescribed medicine is correct. please seek relief and care."
"my son stole my debit card and lied about it. it's not the first time he has lied. i don't know what to do anymore. i don't know if i should punish him or make him do something. i've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. i have grounded him, but nothing works. what should i do?","<p>hi enid, you sound like a sensitive parent; i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. there is some key information here (i don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but i'll give you my thoughts.</p><p>i see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. in order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""what can i get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. if a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). so, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. not all kids steal, but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point. it's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out.&nbsp;</p><p>stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and i'm not surprised he lied about it. if you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. it's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. the behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>it's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). it's a dilemma. if you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. that gives him incentive to come to you with truth. it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. put a cookie on the counter. tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. then ask them later if they took the cookie. you're making honesty fun. kids love games.&nbsp;</p><p>basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative.&nbsp;</p><p>if this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. if it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.&nbsp;</p>"

i am tired of getting in trouble and  being in and out of the er.  this is my third visit this year. maybe i need to change my life.,being in and out of the er and getting into trouble are starting to get tiring. you’re considering what it would take to change things around. being in the er 3 times feels like a tipping point for you. you don't want to end up there again. you're tired of being in the er after fighting. you're ready to make some positive changes in your life. let's look at some options and decide where you'll start. where do you want to start making some changes? it sounds like you need to take your own advice. maybe try writing down how you feel so that you can reflect on it later. start changing and reflect on your life actions. the desire to change your life is the first place to start.  what is it that you find often gets you in the most trouble? let's start there.
"whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting. i say mean things to let my anger out. whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality. i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. i hurt the ones i love with my words. i want to be better for myself and them.","<p>hi california,</p><p>i'm happy to hear you want to get a hold of this problem. relationships don't tend to last when we treat people poorly. it is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating, with some strong effort. i would highly suggest working with a therapist, and i will give you a few things to think about in the interim.</p><p>sometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair, but many times, anger is a ""secondary emotion"", and it's simply there to protect us from other, more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid. discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important. perhaps you feel powerless, or unloved, or unimportant. it may take some time before you recognise this emotion.&nbsp;</p><p>once you do, you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion. where did it originate? at what age did you feel ""too much"" of that feeling...so much so that you can't stand it even in tiny amounts?</p><p>you will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling. they are typically incorrect thoughts, like ""no one lifes me"", or ""people will always hurt me"". fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that aren't likely.</p><p>your habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of self-worth and you don't believe people will love you...so you hurt them to keep them at a distance. this happens in a subconscious level. do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didn't believe in your worth? so, it's backwards really, because you think you're getting mad at people who ""piss you off"", but you're really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourself.</p><p>in addition to this work, you can start to purposely treat people more kindly. find out what respect is, make amends and &nbsp;resolve to spreading peace. it might sound too simple, but if you act as though you're a person of peace, you will start to feel more peaceful.</p><p>but i hope you do contact a therapist. it will take time and support to reach your goal.</p>"
"i have a lot on my mind, but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. why do i feel so alone?","<p>it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. &nbsp;often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. for some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. &nbsp;when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. &nbsp;in this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. the anxiety is the underlying issue. &nbsp;having ""a lot on my mind"" sounds like anxiety. unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with ""emptiness."" &nbsp;</p><p>in the question above, i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having ""a lot on my mind"" and determine where these might be coming from. has there been ongoing rejection from peers? from family? if so, why does this seem to be happening? &nbsp;isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. where does that need to protect originate? &nbsp;are there unmet needs from childhood? are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism?&nbsp;</p><p>we can feel ""alone"" even when in a crow of people or at a party. &nbsp;this has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. it has more to do with how we view ourselves. &nbsp;if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, ""you are worth nothing"" or ""you don't deserve the company of others"" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time.&nbsp;</p><p>the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. &nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.&nbsp;</span><br></p>"

i don’t know why people who never smoked keep bugging me to quit.  my doctor has no idea  how hard it is to even try quitting. i’ve tried to quit many times but can’t even go two days.  no one knows how hard it is to give it up out of the blue.,"quitting cold turkey has not worked for you in the past. it is upsetting to you that you can’t just quit smoking. 
you're frustrated that quitting hasn't come easy.
 trying to quit smoking has been hard for you. if quitting spontaneously won't work, then make a plan to reduce over the next few months.  why can't you make a plan to quit over a few months? they don't understand how hard it is to go through. don't listen to them. quit for yourself. look at yourself and make your own goals to get healthier. have you thought about treatment programs that slowly decrease your addiction over time? cold turkey rarely works due to the withdrawal symptoms. have willpower, you are greater than any addiction, they are there to help you, but it depends on you."
"i have ptsd. the side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships.  i even lost my job month ago. 

how can i get my life back?","<p>hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>i hear you, ptsd has a very&nbsp;debilitating effect on your whole life. i know that from personal experience. recovering from it is possible and doable!&nbsp;</p><p>first is step is to acknowledge to yourself that your ptsd symptoms are a normal reaction to an abnormal and traumatic event. the nightmares, the anxiety, the heightened startle response - are all typical human responses following exposure to a frightening event. it's important that you don't blame yourself or your body for reacting this way, rather approach yourself with&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;and kindness that you would extend a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;who is hurting.&nbsp;</p><p>the second&nbsp;step is to start taking steps towards healing. i would really encourage you to see a counselor or therapist specializing in trauma recovery so that you have a guided, step by step support. but if this is not an option, you can begin your healing on your own using a step-by-step approach outlined in the book,<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/healing-trauma-pioneering-program-restoring/dp/159179658x""> healing trauma, by peter levin</a>. it's a very hands-on book and even comes with a cd audio guide. it has concrete exercises that you can do to help you eliminate dissociation, feel grounded, and decrease your anxiety response. i have used myself and with my clients with great success!&nbsp;</p><p>you can begin your recovery journey now with this video with peter levin's approach to trauma recovery:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjdkzdmllc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjdkzdmllc</a></p><p>one last thing, i suggest consulting with a nutritionist or a doctor to help you boost your healing with supplements, vitamins, and minerals. the stress from ptsd is very draining on the body, and you use up a lot of energy and resources, so at times of trauma supplements are quite necessary for recovery (magnesium, omega 3, zinc, vitamin c....etc)</p>"

","although part of you knows exercise might help you get control of your weight and your blood sugar, fitting it in seems almost impossible given how busy you are at home and at work. the gym turns you off and your husband doesn’t seem like he can be much help either.  but it is something you think could be good for you.  because of your crazy schedule with the kids and your job, you just can't see how to make regular physical activity fit into your schedule right now. you don't see a way to make exercise fit in your schedule. well, you can exercise at home. maybe ride your bike or walk.  ask your husband to help. and don’t worry about how you look nobody is paying attention to you. can you play basketball with your husband? concile your husband to help you with your homework and with your children, so you will have more time and still be able to do some physical activity with more peace of mind. the good news is that diet, not exercise, is the most efficient method of losing weight. you don't need time to hit the gym, but you can always cut back on calories eaten. have you tried looking for ways to incorporate exercise into your routine at home?"

of course i want things to be different but i am not taking any of these antidepressant pills…the pills make it worse.,"you want things to get better but you want to do it without medication. you really don't think that meds are the right path for you. if there was another way you could improve your mood without relying on meds, you might be willing to give it a try.  you want things to be different but don't want to turn to meds. sounds like what you're doing now to manage your mood isn't helping you. you should consider all of your options before dismissing them. do your research. there is significant empirical data to prove medications improve sympoms, not worsen them.  do you think you could worsen if you don't take medication? don't think so, take them if they are indicated and still be excited to find goals and reach them. maybe you should consider trying a different pill? taking pills alone won't workout. unless you decide nobody can change you, try to enjoy cute little things happening around you."
i don't know how to tell someone how i feel about them. how can i get better at expressing how i feel?,"

yourself is vulnerable, and being vulnerable is hard. it takes courage and work
to be vulnerable. my guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable (ie, expressing yourself) is unsafe. my assumption would be
you have been criticized, or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past, it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again. this is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt. it
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional way.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">i would start my practicing and

day to gage where you are at emotionally. after you feel you have a good grasp
on this, start to engage in emotional conversations with others. choose others that
feel safe to you, a good friend that knows you well, or a sibling or family
member. expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection, so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same. best of luck!</span></p>

i get angry and act out. it scares my wife and child.,"<p>anger is a normal emotion, no different than joy, elation, or sadness. it's not anger that gets us in trouble it's the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble. being able to control your temper depends on several variables: how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict, and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations. there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they don't readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode, and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations, they don't take time to think out situations or to make sense of them, they just impulsively respond. i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior. in addition, i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed. the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing, which you have, now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion, and communicate that you're angry. remember, anger is the overt expression of some other emotion (i.e., disappointment, hurt, frustration, etc..) hope this helps...</p>"

i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?,"<p>hello, and thank you for your question. first, i want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. this isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. <br></p><p>it does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. and not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. it sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. i want to tell you that you are not alone. good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. the good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. <br></p><p>ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. this is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. if that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. <br></p><p>personally, i am big fan of dr. john gottman. he is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">the seven principles for making marriage work. </span>dr. gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. you can buy dr. gottman's book on amazon for under $9. it's a good deal. <br></p><p>there are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. here is one that i found that has a few good tips. <br></p><p>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships/effective-communication.htm</p><p> you can try them and see if they are helpful. <br></p><p>***it is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. if you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. <br></p><p>i hope these suggestions help, and good luck.</p><p>robin landwehr, dbh, lpcc <br></p>"

how does a person start the counseling process?,<p>the first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. search online and then set up a phone consultation. a person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. after a consultation then set up an intake questions. the overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.</p>

"i'm transgender, i know i am, but i've only told a few friends. i know i can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. they just wouldn't accept it.
my gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. i need some strategies for dealing with it. what should i do?","<p>this is a difficult situation to be in, as it sounds like you are feeling very isolated from both your family and your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; i don't know your age or gender so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under 18 and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older.&nbsp; one idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who is a ""gender therapist"" or a ""gender specialist.""&nbsp; most therapists who are transgender affirmative also have other specialties and do general therapy.&nbsp; though i don't think lying to your parents is a good idea, if you feel you truly can't talk to them about your gender, then perhaps you can find a therapist with a specialization in gender identity who can help you cope with your gender dysphoria.&nbsp; you can let your parents know that you would like to see that particular therapist for other reasons, such as anxiety/worry, and that you researched them and liked their website.&nbsp; work to find a therapist who takes your parents insurance if you can.&nbsp; you can also talk to the therapist on the phone first, before you talk to your parents about scheduling the first therapy visit. therapists can help you learn some ways to manage feelings of worry, shame, and fear related to gender dysphoria. depending on your family situation, many therapists will work to help you learn skills to safely communicate with your parents about what is troubling you.&nbsp; your parents may actually surprise you and be more accepting than you think.&nbsp; usually when parents learn that you are suffering, they want to be open to learning how they can help you, even if awkwardly at first.<br></p><p>reframing is a tool that helps you think about your situation from other perspectives.&nbsp; it's kind of how you can look at the same picture with a different picture frame and it makes the same picture look a little different. &nbsp; keep in mind your situation is probably temporary and think about in the context of your whole long life (can you tolerate another 2 to 4 years living like you are if you have another x number of years to live?).&nbsp; if you are living at home, you will eventually be more independent and be able to make more of your decisions about your gender expression. keep the idea in mind the concept that is popular in mindfulness classes i teach, that ""this too shall pass"" or ""this is only for now"" when you start to feel hopeless. if you start to over focus on your gender or body issues, try to distract yourself with things that make you feel happy (your pet, music, art, sports etc) or stay busy.&nbsp; <br></p><p>if you can, find any gsa or lgbtiqq youth group that you can attend confidentially, further away from home, to get some support.&nbsp; work to find an ally, one person, that you can talk to about what you are feeling. making new friends online through social media can sometimes be a start in breaking down the isolation you feel. <br></p><p>another idea, if you are under 24 years old, there is a phone line (866-488-7386)&nbsp; to call in case you are ever feeling you are in crisis.&nbsp; you can also text chat! trevor project: http://www.thetrevorproject.org/</p><p>there is also a trans teen online chat group if you are 12-19 http://www.glbthotline.org/transteens.html</p><p>if you are an adult you can get numbers to call in your state if you start to feel suicidal:http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/</p><p><br></p><p>day to day, can you creatively work on your gender dysphoria?&nbsp; yes!&nbsp; are there ways you can focus on parts of your body you love?&nbsp; can you focus on that when you look in the mirror?&nbsp; are you a writer?&nbsp; can you write stories or poetry about the life you imagine for yourself in the future?&nbsp; can you do small things that help you get more in touch with your gender day to day like making small choices about your clothing, like wearing clothes that are more unisex,&nbsp; that only you know are gender related but others won't notice?&nbsp; you cannot force others to accept you but you can work on your self-acceptance and self-compassion. that work is something that is best done in the company of others like you as well as with at least another person who gets you and whom you can trust.&nbsp; good luck to you!&nbsp; </p>"
how does a person start the counseling process?,"<p>first, identify the areas that you need help with. what are the issues that are most troubling you? are these situations creating an impact on your daily routine?</p><p>second, do some research as to the type of counselling service you are looking and that would best suit your needs. are you looking for individual sesssions, couples/family sessions, etc. and research potential therapists in your area that focus their counselling approach on your therapeutic needs.&nbsp;</p><p>third, contact the therapist (most don't answer the phones, so leave a message or send an email). don't be affraid to ask questions. you want to make sure that this professional is a good ""match"" for you and will work with you at working toward your therapeutic goals (the things you want to address/work on during the sessions).</p><p>fourth, have the expectation that, depending on the issues, you will need multiple sessions/appointments with the therapist to really address the issues and work toward your therapeutic goals.</p><p>it takes strength and courage to reach out for help, but i know you can reach your goals. it takes time, patience, and practice do really address your needs.&nbsp;</p><p>good luck!</p>"

had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practice's focuses. &nbsp;the answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session. &nbsp;if you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach, in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives (subjective, intersubjective, objective and
interobjective – also known as the four quadrants) in determining where the
challenges are, it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situation.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">in this case, from the upper-right
or behavioral and physical perspective, we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked (such as blood pressure.&nbsp; we would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance (such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornography).&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">next we would look at the
upper left quadrant (thoughts, cognitions, identity, feelings) to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times.&nbsp; if you are worried about your job, your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate, this can
contribute to your situation.&nbsp; from there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant (cultural rules and tools) to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift, update and/or reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges.&nbsp; it would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your family/culture of origin views the profession.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">finally, we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant (systems, laws,
rules of society) such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available.&nbsp; once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you need.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">to sum your question then
of why you can’t keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts (look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after), look at
your behaviors, look at your physical body for issues, look at where you picked
up your rules and tools (culture) and look at your ability to access goods and
services.&nbsp; they all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account.&nbsp; so - as you can see, there is no one possible answer to this, but several. &nbsp;i hope this helps.&nbsp;</span></p>"
"i am so angry. i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and i don't know what to do. i want to sit down with a psychologist, but i cannot afford one, nor do i have my own health insurance. i can feel myself starting to get violent. i throw things of value when i start to get mad. i have punched holes in my wall. i can feel my aggression getting worse.","<p>first off, it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made. it is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from. fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with&nbsp;life's obstacles, including anger management. there are several strategies that you can try to&nbsp;help control your anger, but the&nbsp;ones that&nbsp;i would recomend first are the following:</p><p>1.&nbsp;try a different way of communicating with your parents. since&nbsp;arguing with&nbsp;them is a great source of anger for you, learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit.&nbsp;choose a time to talk with them&nbsp;about ""heated issues"" when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. use ""i phrases"" by telling them how the arguments effect you, as opposed to placing blame on them.&nbsp;validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.</p><p>2. when you feel yourself becoming angry, take a break. simply excuse yourself from the situation, find a quiet place to be by yourself, and do some deep breathing. close your eyes, slowly count to four as you inhale, and exhale&nbsp;even slower, counting to 6. focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.</p><p>3. stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. often times when we get upset, we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. when you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. if you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid, then let them go and replace them with realistic, logical thoughts.</p><p>4. finally, find a friend or someone to talk to and/or keep a journal. keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.</p><p>i wish you all the best!<br></p>"

"my dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. i cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when i know he isn't. i have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. i never find anything, but i'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. how do i stop this? it's driving a wedge between us.","<p>hi greenville, i respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. the truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.</p><p>the answer here is in two different areas. basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.</p><p>your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. these thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (i know lots of good men, i know i deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). you're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. that's the first half. practise these thoughts.</p><p>the rest of the work is in your behaviours. act as though you trust him. force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.</p><p>it's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. good luck!</p>"
"i have known i was always different. this year, in december, i found out that i never felt female. i did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. this is certainly a tough spot. i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things. </p><p>you may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues, or if you have ever heard him talk about it. that may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. for example, if he has been watching the news lately, transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. has he had an opinion? this won't tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender, but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. </p><p>to tell you the truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. there is no right or wrong way, best or worst. if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? that's perfect. want to have a friend with you for support? equally perfect. whatever thing you need to do. and, of course, there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. </p><p>unfortunately, the response from your dad can't be predicted. some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. this is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. if things get heated, you have someone in your corner. </p><p>there are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. you can also google some stories about how others came out.</p><p>i refer many people to the www.letsqueerthingsup.com blog. it is a popular blog written by a trans man that i know. he writes on many topics related to trans issues. </p><p>hope some of these suggestions help. be well... be you.. and good luck!</p><p><br></p><p>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

how does a person start the counseling process?,<p>i think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time. &nbsp;you need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need. &nbsp;to many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to re-engage. &nbsp;remembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so i would treat it as such. do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help you.&nbsp;</p>
"i have been married for 11 years. within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. i often feel that my husband has ""friends"" at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. i feel very alone and just uncared for.  is there anything i can do to feel reconnected?","<p>your question highlights your pain very clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples: one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward.&nbsp;my mind immediately goes to a question for you: what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? what do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?&nbsp; what do you do in response to these feelings? do you ask for what you need?&nbsp; does this lead to arguments?&nbsp; do you stay silent or withdraw?</p><p>very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as ""cold and aloof"" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as ""critical and nagging"").&nbsp; regardless of ""who started it,"" these patterns can&nbsp;turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship.&nbsp; if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together.&nbsp; as the patterns&nbsp;slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.</p><p>some couples can do this without the help of a therapist.&nbsp; the book ""hold me tight: 7 conversations for a lifetime of love"" by sue johnson is a self-help book based on emotionally focused therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that i see.&nbsp; when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as emotionally focused therapy.&nbsp; you can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here: <a href=""http://www.iceeft.com"">http://www.iceeft.com</a>).</p><p>to summarize:</p><p>your pain is understandable and valid.&nbsp; it's telling you what you are missing and what you want.</p><p>reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs,&nbsp;while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.</p><p>if you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that's fantastic!&nbsp; if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated.&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>pain means this is important!&nbsp; you and your marriage are worth the effort!<br></p>"

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>if you have only been to a couple of sessions, it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first. therapy is hard work! you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before. opening up to stranger can be scary. after you feel comfortable with your counselor, and trust has built up and you feel understood in session, you should feel more relaxed. i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions, it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from. for example, are you and the therapist not a good fit? but, again if you are just starting out in working together, feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense, and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.</p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision. here are a few examples.&nbsp;</p><p>the counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with. a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue. if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer. beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues. this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues.&nbsp;</p><p>another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit. no counselor is the right person to work with everyone. if the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work. a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session.&nbsp;</p><p>the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on. while this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end. however, counselors know that this is part of the process. they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end. this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.&nbsp;</p><p>all of these (and other) situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending, to monitoring how things are going, then engaging in self reflection, possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor &nbsp;follows through.&nbsp;</p>"

"i have known i was always different. this year, in december, i found out that i never felt female. i did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.","<p>i admire your courage.</p><p>if you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity, i would suggest a couple of things. there are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now. i don't mean to convey that everyone thinks, feels, or acts the same by any means, but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiences.</p><p>i was trying to include some links for you, but that particular button isn't functioning window. if you search for ""transgender support"" on google, you'll find glaad and pflag, both of which are national organizations. this does not mean that you have to identify as ""transgender,"" but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.</p><p>as far as telling your dad, if that is particularly concerning for you, i suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member (one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time) so that you can talk with some people to have support. this may help with two things: allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him.</p><p>one thing that i tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation. that way, you have greater chances of having the person's attention and/or not needing to end the conversation quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>also, please remember that you know yourself best, as each of us does.</p>"
"i'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. 

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?","<p>thanks for writing. there are many different house of things that may be helpful here. i can give you some general ideas, but if some of these things don't get you to where you would like to go, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples:</p><ul><li>remember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. you can ask him to make changes, but you can't control whether he does or not. you can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions in the relationship.</li><li>if you're going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen, first ask whether this is a good time.</li><li>try to talk to him without blaming, finger-pointing, or asking him to change (this can be difficult, but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussions).</li><li>be mindful of your packaging. by that, i mean that you may have a very important message that you're trying to get across. if you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what you're actually saying, that is helpful. if you are talking in ways that are angry, or as i sometimes say, wrapped in spikes, that can be difficult to hear and receive. rather than hearing what you're actually trying to get across, he may just hear the fact that you are angry.</li><li>if your husband is able to listen to you and/or restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right, let him know what that feels like to you and how important it is.</li><li>if you're asking questions, try to avoid ""why"" question and use ""what makes, how, when, where, who"" instead. questions starting with ""why"" can not only be difficult to answer, but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right away.</li><li>also, keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement. this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband – just because he is hearing what you're saying doesn't mean that he's agreeing with you.</li><li>lastly, but importantly, some people really don't know how to listen effectively. there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives. sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerability-producing. it may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that he's really struggling.</li></ul>"

i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?,"<p>the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue. it consists of 3 steps:</p><p>1. mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn't.</p><p>2. validating. you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (if you don't understand, then find a way.) you can also say, ""that makes sense"" or ""i hear you"" or ""i get that.""</p><p>3. empathizing. tell her how you think she must feel about what she's telling you. your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her.</p><p>this is a very different way of communicating than we're used to. my guess is that the arguments, discussions, and debates you've had with her have been counterproductive because you're both trying to win. with imago dialogue, you both win. she gets to be heard and you get to hear for a change.</p><p>at the end of the exercise, switch roles. for more info:&nbsp;http://imagorelationships.org/pub/about-imago-therapy/imago-dialogue-101/</p>"
"i was the one who ended it, and i'm so glad i did. it was the best decision i made in my life. but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks? it is creating a wall in my current relationship.","<p>&nbsp;a lot of times when you're experiencing nightmares and flashbacks, it can be a sign that you haven't fully processed what happened. our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or &nbsp;in an effort to desensitize us to it. &nbsp;if you are comfortable with it, you may want to consider sharing what you're experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand what's going on. also, you may want to consider &nbsp;what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for. this can be a difficult task to undertake on your own, and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way. &nbsp;typically however, flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma &nbsp;of what you went through needs to be addressed. &nbsp;it's a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that. &nbsp;you may want to &nbsp;begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it (i.e. &nbsp;feeling like it's your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner, blaming yourself for being &nbsp;"" the kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship "", &nbsp;or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way.) &nbsp;these types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them.&nbsp;</p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>there are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling. &nbsp;a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client. &nbsp;this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time. &nbsp;if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy, it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy. &nbsp;the process of termination must not injure the client and, if necessary, the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities. &nbsp;another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care. &nbsp;if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else, he or she may need a higher level of care. &nbsp;in this circumstance, the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit. &nbsp;a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship. &nbsp;for example, if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship. &nbsp;in this instance, the clinician should refer the client to another therapist. &nbsp;finally, if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment, the clinician and client should terminate treatment.</p>"

what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","<p>many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young. &nbsp;when young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs. &nbsp;the good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts. &nbsp;the first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought. &nbsp;so for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest. &nbsp;you catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". stop this thought, and replace it with ""you didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked. &nbsp;let's figure out how you can do better next time."" &nbsp;or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". so the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend. &nbsp;you might also pick up the book, feeling good, by david burns. he gives many tips for how to change negative self talk.</p>"

how can i help myself to change my behavior?","<p>hello. i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you. in other words, does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it. yes, this could well be an expression of anxiety, or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee-jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific (or perhaps even non-specific) circumstances. do you think it is a self-soothing behavior? do you feel good after you have done it? the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage, so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor, to rule out any injury. if none exists, this obviously doesn't excuse the behavior, it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.</p><p>when we do any behavior of any kind, it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. is the behavior helping us to solve our problem, or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue, when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there, but now they are intoxicated. no closer to solving the issue. when we deal with things like anxiety or depression, we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms, but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm, but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.</p><p>sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self-harm, wouldn't you agree? so i would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings, as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.</p><p>reach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you.</p>"
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif;"">goodbyes can be hard.
chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult. saying goodbye to a therapist can be different. it can be an
opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life.

transformative as the therapy itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif;"">ending therapy is also known

however, it is what it is. it is an ending of the relationship as it existed.
it is reality cold and stark. of course, when i talk to clients i don’t use the
word “termination,” i usually say “our goodbye.” &nbsp;under what circumstances does therapy usually
end? therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance, is not
receiving any benefit from therapy, or might be harmed by continuing to work

the decision to move on from therapy and “say our goodbyes” happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up!&nbsp; ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session. what i mean by that
is, there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently. so the first session i
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif;"">now sometimes there are

end the relationship and refer the client to someone else. this is in the
client’s best interest. another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful.&nbsp; a therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce. a good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else. this is good practice

"i'm always told i'm not good enough or trying hard enough. i put 100% in to every thing. i'm worn out, i've worked on all of my family relationships, i'm doing great in school, i'm kind to those in need and otherwise. i stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so i don't have to make as many and the ones i do i learn from. 
somehow it's still not good enough and nothing i do works. nothing has changed, and i feel hopeless. any suggestions or ideas?","<p>hello, and let me say first, what a great question! </p><p>there are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. without being able to fully understand where you're question is coming from, i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.</p><p>first, i think it's important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you're &#34;not good enough.&#34; is that actually what they said, or is this just what you heard? sometimes, because of our own self-doubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? if so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you're spending on being &#34;good enough.&#34; explore with them how you feel you'r already giving your best.</p><p>if the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. it may be they have their own &#34;stuff&#34; going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. if you're in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. if it's a relationship that must continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. until they're willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation. </p><p>another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it's important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? no one will ever be 100% &#34;good enough&#34; for everyone. every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. </p><p>the question becomes, what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations? there is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels &#34;less than&#34; and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. it then becomes impossible to every feel &#34;good enough&#34; for others, because it's really you you're trying to feel good enough for. if you already feel as if you're doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on letting go of the rest. no one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of what's left. after all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!</p><p>i recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, &#34;no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. &#34; - eleanor roosevelt. </p>"
"i'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  the only time i go out is for my college classes. sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them, but sometimes i won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

sometimes i feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

are they right, am i depressed?","<p>hello. being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. we look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. if that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: not much of those problems i've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), i can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.</p><p>when we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. so the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? that is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. in your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. it is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. it is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).</p><p>have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? if not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. they are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. its called teen line (https://teenlineonline.org/). it helped me when i was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. you might also check with your school for assistance.</p><p>don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. adults don't always have a handle on it either. being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. but you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. i wish for you the very best, and bright future.&nbsp;</p>"
"i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to, i never fully meet what they want. i feel that when i finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. i feel like  they just want nothing to do with me.","it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? if your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.<br><br>one possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. you ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.<br><p><br></p>"

i don’t trust doctors.  i don’t trust the cdc.  god gave us an immune system and as a healthy persons that is all i need to protect myself from getting covid.   i think this is all a bunch of hysteria and profiteering by the pharm industry,"you feel that your immune systems is strong enough to protect you from getting covid-19 and you don’t trust the motives of the health system and pharmaceutical industry. you don’t think they are telling us the truth about covid-19.  they have ulterior motives. putting your trust in others is hard for you. it scares you that a company or entity potentially could be experimenting on you with their treatments. you believe god will protect you from covid-19. well, we don’t know who is naturally able to avoid getting covid-19.  the vaccine is the best way to avoid it even if you have a good immune system.  most religious leaders are recommending that their congregants get vaccinated.  do you think everyone in healthcare is in it for the money? otherwise, the fight against covid is hard, so stop these thoughts. well, taking covid vaccine can help you in developing immunity against the virus. you won't be able to spread the virus among your closed ones. this can create a safe environment for everyone. so my advice is that you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. how does your opinion affect the people around you?"
"everyone has some abnormal genes, i’m probably not at any more risk than anyone else.","you don’t really see the purpose of genetic testing. you’re not convinced it’ll provide you with any helpful information. you're not entirely convinced that you might be at risk. you don't think you're at greater risk than the average person. we don't know your risk without genetic testing. you think everyone has some abnormal genes? risks are very relative, they can be greater or lesser for one person, but anything that harms is not good. your risk and the way you feel about it is valid. it is out of your control so all you can do is let go and hope for the best, worrying over something that you cannot possibly change serves no one. always be safe, even if the odds are low, it's better to be safe now than to be sorry later."
"i'm in my late 20s, and i've never had a boyfriend or even been on a date. i have no friends. i hate facebook because everyone else has kids and a great husband and great paying jobs. i work in retail, and i can't find a job. i have an associate degree. no one is not giving me a chance, and i'm getting upset and frustrated. i feel worthless and feel like everyone hates me. i feel like a failure, and i still live with my dad. it's very embarrassing!","<p>in case knowing this helps you, there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realize.</p><p>similar to you, they are not on fb for the reasons you list. &nbsp;plus, no one wants to go on fb and tell the world they don't have a fantastic life. &nbsp;everyone on fb is happy, even when they're miserable they're happy telling everyone about it.</p><p>first, yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living. &nbsp;please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have, is not necessarily the true life they are having. &nbsp;i've been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30, start having problems by their mid-thirties.</p><p>second, respect your unique identity. &nbsp;for whatever reason, you have more sensitivity, possibly more depth, more complex standards and expectations, of yourself and others.</p><p>as hard as it may sound or actually be, take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you, you need for your own growth and development.</p><p>feeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive. &nbsp;consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goals.</p><p>i hope this helps!</p><p><br></p>"

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>well, it's generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy, particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through, much less to someone who you don't know well, can be anxiety-producing. it's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.</p><p>the most important thing i can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. there are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. personally, i can tell you that i would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. that opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.</p><p>thanks for writing here. if it caused anxiety for you to do so, i hope that feeling is diminishing for you, at least related to writing here.</p>"

"i've been depressed for quite a while. i've been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. my insurance has a $5000 deductible, so i’m screwed. i've had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. i have no one. my family doesn't care about me; they kicked me out when i turned 18 a few years ago. i had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. my ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him, i break down into tears. i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression.","<p>it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit.&nbsp;</p><p>depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways. &nbsp;the best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program (eap) if offered by your employer. if not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.&nbsp;</p><p>if, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in cognitive behavioural therapy, or cbt), such as ""mind over mood"". &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>"

"i like going to the gym, i like exercising; i exercise a couple hours a week. but i’m not sure what to do when the gym is closed.","you know that exericse is good for you and you enjoy going to the gym. right now you're looking for ideas of things you can do to get physical activity on the days the gym is closed. you're already exercising a couple hours a week. now it's just a matter of figuring out what to do for physical activity on the days you can't make it to the gym. you enjoy working out and going to the gym. you can do a modified version of those things outside or even from home. let's look at the exercises you're doing at the gym and make a plan. what about running outside? actually exercising does not always require a gym. may be you can try jogging in the backyard. go jogging, walking or gym is not everything. maybe you could go for a walk or a run or try an at home exercise video."

i'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. am i a pedophile because i'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"<p>no, that's perfectly normal. you're under 18, too. you're only a year older than she is. this is absolutely normal. what would be wrong is if you did anything to her against her will. always remember that no means no, respect her, respect yourself, and be a normal teenager! have a healthy relationship. holding hands, kissing, and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it. although it is frowned upon by a lot of people, it's no secret that teenagers do have sex (even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it). only you can make the choice that is right for you. just be responsible in the choices you make. some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex. you'd be surprised how young those ages are. a 14 year old having sex with a 20 year old would be against the law, but someone the same age as her, or just one year older is not. ""wrong"" can be defined in a lot of different ways, though. is it against the law? no. is it against your religion? i can't answer that for you.&nbsp;</p><p>you can, however, have a relationship that is not physical in any way. it's okay to just be with her and enjoy her company. you can hang out, watch movies together, go on dates, do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing. your relationship can be anything you want it to be.&nbsp;</p>"

""moving on"" then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your ex-partner as far as is possible for the sake of your child's development.</p><p>generally, it's good for a functional (non-abusive) parent to spend time with his/her child, but only insofar as that doesn't cause your child unnecessary stress. that requires the two adults to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">act</span> like adults with each other for the sake of their child.</p><p>what's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.</p><p>but if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). when dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. if you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation. if that's not an option, then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules (for which you'd have to consult with an attorney).<br></p>"

"my depression has been reoccurring for a long time. it all started when i was being bullied in high school. in ninth grade, my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. after that, i was fine for a couple of years. i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. i believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. obviously, that wasn't the right choice. i regret ever doing that, seeing as even though i'm not self-harming anymore, i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed. i have a big problem with handling problems in life. whenever a problem arises, i get stressed and i feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. i get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldn't be sad all the time, and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.","<p>i couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. &nbsp;unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm.&nbsp;</p><p>from what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. &nbsp;often, when i am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. &nbsp;when we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. for example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. for example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? &nbsp;is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?</p><p>try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.</p>"
"i was with my friends fishing by a pond. i found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. i'm not sure why i did it. my friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

now if someone brings it up i get really upset and panicked. i don't know why i feel like this. does this mean there is something wrong with me?","<p>the good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>i'm glad you have awareness and i'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.</p><p>fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.</p><p>basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.</p><p>use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain. &nbsp; reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you. &nbsp; it is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.</p><p>stabbing innocent frogs is wrong. &nbsp;it is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.</p><p>it is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.</p><p>the direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).</p>"
"i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?","<p>your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are, than you realize. &nbsp; fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesn't get rid of them.</p><p>think about whether you felt secure and confident as a child. &nbsp;also, did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing up?</p><p>often these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives. &nbsp;if the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago, then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances, may help you to dissolve the current fear.</p><p><br></p><p>another possibility is cbt, cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe, say being a passenger in a commercial airplane, which feels frightening to a person.</p><p>cbt is short term and results are limited to specific fears. &nbsp;</p><p>it is a much quicker approach than self-understanding.</p><p><br></p>"
"my dad is always, and i mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. he makes me feel stupid. he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. is this abuse?","<p>oh my goodness, my heart goes out to you!! &nbsp;i pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you. if you are in school,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resources.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">i believe m</span>ost therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional and verbal abuse</span>. and quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having his/her emotions preyed upon as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><div><span style=""color: rgb(58, 58, 58);

validating the potential emotional pain you are feeling right now. there is
generally no lack of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, sadness, and anger. these are
all normal emotions and being allowed to feel them is the beginning of the
healing process. it might be helpful to talk about these feeling with your fiancé,
a friend or a counselor.</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">now to get to your primary question.
can a relationship move past infidelity? the short answer is yes. a bit longer
of an explanation is that is sounds like you and your fiancé had pieces of a solid
foundation to base a relationship on. for many couples they encounter a primary
challenge, sometimes that's money, or parenting and for some it's sexuality. if
you and your fiancé are both committed to balancing the positive aspects of your
relationship while improving the challenges than it's definitely possible to
move past this. this is not an easy process and for many couples takes months
or years of healing while engaging in relationship counseling.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">good luck to you and your continues

i just wanted to get to know one so i can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. i also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"<p>mental health is an exciting and rewarding field. &nbsp;i hear you saying that you want to be a psychologist, and that is one path to working in mental health. &nbsp;you could study psychology,&nbsp;social work or counseling to become a practicing therapist. i am a licensed professional counselor associate and a licensed clinical&nbsp;addiction specialist. &nbsp;i currently provide assessments and supervise several counselors in a large clinic in asheville. &nbsp;i also have a private practice online. i studied sociology and interpersonal communication as an undergraduate, and then i received a counseling masters degree. &nbsp; my master's degree was comprised of several supervised practice courses and theory courses. &nbsp; &nbsp;i really enjoyed my education, and i find my career equally rewarding and enjoyable. if you are considering working in the field, i recommend emailing several counselors, social workers, and psychologists in your area and setting up an informational interview. &nbsp;not everyone you contact will be willing to give you their time, but many may. &nbsp; this will help you determine which path to therapy may be right for you. &nbsp;licensing restrictions and abilities&nbsp;vary state to state and a local practitioner may be able to provide you with a specific list of challenges/triumphs about their particular license and education. &nbsp; &nbsp;psychologists are usually phd level practitioners and require more education to begin. &nbsp;lcsws , lpcs and lmfts can practice with a master's degree. &nbsp;best of luck! this is an exciting time. &nbsp;</p>"
"i am in a high stress position for a tech company. i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing.

what can i do to manage my stress?","<p>hello. workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive. the interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag, and sorting that out can be difficult. also, if you are feeling under appreciated and not well paid, this can add bitterness to your lot of emotions. a few questions can be kept in mind as you work through your situation. do you have the option of talking to your employer about your experiences and feelings with regard to your current work? do you have local resources that you can use to find different jobs in your field? do you have connections with employment counselors or agencies that can support you with strategies in dealing with workplace stress? these questions might cause others to bubble up, and could begin a new journey into a new field.</p><p>while still at your job, what can you do to take care of yourself? are you taking breaks? do you eat lunch at the office, or do you go somewhere away from the office to eat? what do you do when you have a few moments to breathe? understanding that you can indeed find even the smallest strategies useful for self-care, can help bolster your energy and give you some support as you move through the day. seeking the support of family and friends can be helpful as well. knowing your personal limits and when to pull back and take a break will give you a chance to recharge your mental and physical energy, thus helping you face the demands of your job.&nbsp;</p>"
"i started dating my fiancé two years ago. my first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","<p>based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother&nbsp;takes the issues&nbsp;to you.&nbsp; i do not like to assume so i will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.&nbsp; enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.&nbsp; triangulation is&nbsp;two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;from someone who has dealt with&nbsp;both&nbsp;these issues on&nbsp;a personal level,&nbsp;being informed about&nbsp;family dynamics is beneficial and can help&nbsp;you develop healthy boundaries for yourself&nbsp;within your family structure.&nbsp; you may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.&nbsp; although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.&nbsp; hope this help!<br></p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions. it's really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling, so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions. sometimes, however, a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselor's expertise. that's a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of &nbsp;how best to meet them, whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider.</p>"

parent of a child potentially eligible for a clinical trial for duchenne: i don’t see why i need to test him. his older brother is doing great and he hates having his blood drawn.,"you’re concerned about putting your child through additional testing and don’t really want to expose him to anymore blood draws. you might feel differently about testing him if his older brother wasn't doing so well. you don't see a reason to test your child for duchenne. your child and his brother have different genes. we need to test him to see if he has duchenne. the blood draw is a quick procedure. can you bribe him for the blood draw? i think that testing can be beneficial and helpful for not only the child, but future children. ultimately it's up to you, but if it's safe then whats the harm. this is necessary, not just relying on your convictions. ok"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including, but not limited to the client reaching their goals, the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. &nbsp;the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. &nbsp;all of these things could happen, and usually happen organically (again, except for the last example).&nbsp;</p><p>your question, however, was about the counselor ending treatment. this is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. &nbsp;it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. &nbsp;it's important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?</p><p>in regular, open-ended sessions, i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. in these check-ins, i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. &nbsp;i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. &nbsp;in goal-oriented sessions, i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.&nbsp;</p><p>often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. &nbsp;this is actually a great place to go with them; why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. that said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up.&nbsp;</p><p>in the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. it's a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed.&nbsp;</p><p>i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward!</p>"

i don’t want to stir up trouble by telling my siblings about my diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.,"you’re worried that the news of your diagnosis might have a negative impact on your family. since you're unsure how your family is going to respond to the news, it seems easier to just skip the conversation and keep the news to yourself.  your family will be upset about your diagnosis. maybe your siblings will be less upset if they have more information. here are some handouts you can give them. don't you feel obligated to tell them? tell them yes, because they are your brothers, trust them more. why do you think it would stir up trouble? your health is certainly very personal and private, but if it's something that may affect them as well, it is important to share it. i don't believe you will stir up trouble and you need to understand that they're willing to listen to you. they want to hear from you and it's a lot worse keeping your diagnosis a secret."

i'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. everything is a constant reminder.  how do i move on?,"<p>dealing with a breakup is difficult. we have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. first, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. if we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. so in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. the second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. you might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. by replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. when we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. they are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. this is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. if you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning. i hope this helps. take good care of yourself!&nbsp;</p>"

i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?,"<p>the answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation.&nbsp;</p><p>a lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. you internalize it and accept it as your reality.&nbsp;</p><p>the first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood. children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. the obvious, such as being abused, can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem, but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.</p><p>you may have never been physically or sexually abused, but what about emotionally? were you yelled at, berated, put down? were you told you'd never amount to anything? were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short, couldn't live up to expectations? when you hear something over and over again, you start to believe it.</p><p>maybe you weren't yelled at. maybe it was the opposite. studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. a chronically depressed mother, for example, may have seemed cold, detached, emotionless. she may have been less likely to show interest in a child's life, not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.&nbsp;</p><p>if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up, chances are, a lot of the attention went to them, which could have led to your needs not being met.</p><p>any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant, unheard, unloved, or like they don't matter.</p><p>maybe nothing i've described here fits your situation. if you can't pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own, a counselor can help.</p><p>i am not saying ""blame it on your parents"" or telling you there's nothing you can do to change it! quite the opposite! understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the why. then behavior - the how.&nbsp;</p>"

sometimes i feel guilty that i hurt her.  people tell me real men don’t hit their women. i don’t know. maybe they’re right.,"being labeled a ‘real man’ is important to you. if you have to stop hitting her to be labeled a ‘real man’, you’re thinking you might want to start changing how you treat her. when you think about how you've hurt her in the past, you feel remorse and regret. you feel bad that you hurt your girlfriend. feeling guilty is an indicator that you need to make a change. she deserves to feel safe and loved. maybe you should consider taking some time away from her so you can heal. is there anyone you respect that also hits the people they claim to love? i think that there's other ways you can get your anger out that is more healthy. stay away from others when you are mad and isolate. you should feel guilty. nobody has the right to hit anyone except in self-defense. perhaps we should work on anger control. yes men don't hit women, never in any situation."

"i'm a young adult woman, and i have trouble finding my true identity being at home. this all started when i had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. my boyfriend and i were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. at the time, i was pretty religious, but i let this happen. i don't know why. i felt kind of guilty but mostly because i know my parents wouldn't like it. my parents are very religious—they're christians. we did things every time he'd come over to my house. we didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.

one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","<p>what a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. i would say the first thing you want to do is&nbsp;(if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting&nbsp;them know what you need from them. if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. you, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the&nbsp;relationship you have with your parents. it always helps to try and see things from another angle. you might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. </p><p>are you living with your parents and do they support you? if so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow&nbsp;their rules? know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper.&nbsp;not everyone will always approve of the choices&nbsp;we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. best of luck to you.<br></p>"
i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. i really want to stop it and enjoy things.,"<p>thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency. human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people, places, and things to let us know more about ourselves. we also have an inner voice, dialogue, conscience, etc. that helps us to determine the path for us. often, when someone is worried about the external feedback, and focuses on this as the sole source of information, it can create a dependency that can become problematic. balance is key to so many things in life. your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek. don't discount it and rely only on the voices of others.<br></p>"

"something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for. when i think about what happened, i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.","<p>hello, and thank you for your question. guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. however, i will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.</p><p>one of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. people may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. so, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. in fact, as i write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. for whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. </p><p>now accountability is different than guilt. accountability can actually be constructive.&nbsp; when you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. that it hurt others and you deeply regret it. that you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.&nbsp;that&nbsp;you&nbsp;have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. that you are sorry. and then you move on. </p><p>why is moving on necessary? well, for one thing, it doesn't&nbsp;usually&nbsp;help the people who you hurt. in fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. </p><p>having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. sometimes we need help to work through it. there are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. you can try amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor. </p><p><br></p><p>be well,</p><p>robin landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds.  i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted.
i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding. what i wanted will never happen.
i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset.
i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just can't control it. it's ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it. plus, i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed. 
why can't i move on?","<p>it's hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement. this was something that you and most women think about for years, so it's understandable to be disappointed. but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect. you may envy your friends' weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own and/or it wasn't as perfect as they had planned it either. </p><p>however, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing.  how many women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? i assure you that there are plenty. </p><p>try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. focus on what you can control now. perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?</p><p>i would also be upfront with your husband and explain why you've been short lately. but after that, close that chapter and move on. it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly don't want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change.</p>"
"i always see the worst end of things. my boyfriend and i aren't talking, and i swear he's leaving me. i keep failing my road test, and i see my future crumble. i have no desire for friends. i pushed my best friend away after christmas, and i have no desire to fix it or make new friends. my aunt died, and i cry all the time, even if i burn my lunch.","<p>i really love that you're taking responsibility for your pessimism here. there's a modern parable about two young brothers. one child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable; the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy. so then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. he says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says ""with all this sh-t, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!""</p><p>happiness is a state of mind, and i hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. that's a wonderful start.</p><p>research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. you say ""i always see the worst end of things"". that's pessimism. life is like an elephant. if all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change.&nbsp;</p><p>the key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. i know how to fix friendships), 2. specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). on the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something you created. not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women.&nbsp;</p><p>the feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. i think you know how; but you lack energy right now. if tackling this on your own isn't enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy. i wish you the best.</p>"
"i am a really shy person. i'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. how can i get more confident?","<p>wow, congratulations on being in a masters program. you are in a unique place. so few have reached that level. you should give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p>confidence is not something that comes naturally. but can and does come with practice.</p><p>having gone through two masters programs i can sympathize with your your dilemma.&nbsp;</p><p>so how is the stress affecting you?</p><p>is it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just ""butterflies""?</p><p>there are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress. much depends on how serious the stress is.</p><p>so here are a few ideas:</p><p>1. practice in front of a mirror.</p><p>sounds strange but the practice helps.</p><p>2. ask some friends to listen to your presentations.&nbsp;</p><p>not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting.</p><p>3. focus on the material you are presenting.&nbsp;</p><p>the subject matter is what you want to get across. step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present. let the material you present be the focus.&nbsp;</p><p>4. remember everyone else is just as nervous as you.&nbsp;</p><p>share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them. focus on a friendly face during the presentation. be a support to them in return.</p><p>5. ""fake it, till you make it"".&nbsp;</p><p>yes it sounds blunt.&nbsp;</p><p>but sometimes that's what it takes. even if you feel like it, you won't die.</p><p><br></p><p>so much more can be discussed with a competent counselor. take the time to let a professional help you work through this.<br></p><p>again you have come a long way to be in a graduate program. congratulations you have done great work so far. it's just one step at a time, take the steps.</p><p><br></p>"
"i know i need to lose weight. i have high blood pressure and diabetes, but i just can't seem to get started. every day i say to myself, 'tomorrow i’ll  start a diet"". but somehow i never quite get going.","you want to do something about it, but are looking for something to jumpstart you.  you are at a loss for why you haven’t been able to get things under control. you want to lose weight but are struggling getting started. obesity is a serious health condition. obesity can cause diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and even cancer.  have you tried counting calories? tomorrow never comes. you need to start today before wish i knew becomes the only option. health first, if you don't take care you will die, so stop making excuses that you can't change. what if you start by doing something small everyday? like trying a walk one day or having something healthy for lunch another."

"i'm a girl, and i can't tell whether i'm bisexual or gay. i like girls a little more than boys, but i don't really know.","<p>sexual orientation is not always something that is clearly definable. some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end, only girls is at the other, and bisexual is in the middle. anywhere in between those points can be any amount of attraction to boys or girls.</p><p>if you don't know whether you are gay or bisexual, that is okay. a lot of people don't know for quite some time. in addition to that, after people do know who they are attracted to, a lot of times they do not use the terms ""gay"" or ""bisexual"" for quite a while.</p><p>it's okay not to know.</p><p>think about what sorts of expectations you have for your ideal relationship. some examples may include trust, respect, availability for conversation or connection, etc. whatever it is that you find important in a relationship is likely what matters most.</p><p>if you are struggling with learning what it is that you would like in a relationship or any other feelings connected with what you are thinking and feeling, i would suggest connecting with a local therapist so you have a place to talk about what you are experiencing.</p>"
"i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. not a year ago, i had a car accident. could this experience add more problems?","<p>a car accident can be a traumatic event. especially, &nbsp;if it was serious, you could have feared for your life, felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards.&nbsp;</p><p>this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military. if it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off ptsd symptoms. even if it didn't, it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response.&nbsp;</p><p>having already been diagnosed with ptsd, this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience. the right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention.&nbsp;</p>"
i just keep thinking about what people in my church would think of me if they ever found out about me ending a pregnancy.,"what other people think of your decisions is important to you. you're uncertain what people in the church think about abortion. you want to know what people in your church would think. you'd be relieved if you could lie to the church about how your pregnancy ended. do you think you could hide an abortion? only interrupt if it's something harmful to your health, if you can continue, continue, and if you don't want the life generated, donate it to someone. people  wonth think anything you be yourself always this is a natural thing to think about. however, i will remind you that what you do or don't do with your body is not their business. you do not have to share anything with them at all."
i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>hello. first, i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. they can be intense, i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you. </p><p>there could be a number of things occurring. therapy is a delicate, private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,&nbsp;your continued &nbsp;dedication and motivation will take you far. </p><p>i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that &nbsp;that you feel nervous and shaky. i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. </p><p>this is&nbsp;your time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. </p><p>if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. i understand this is difficult. if i may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. when you begin, i suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are&nbsp;incredibly helpful. we often forget to breathe, especially when we&nbsp; are feeling anxious. </p><p>you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. wishing you the very best!</p><p>laura cassity, lmsw, lmac</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
"i have no sex drive due to medical issues. i’ve shut down completely and closed everyone out. i’ve even told my husband that i wanted a divorce since that’s what i thought he wanted to hear. however, it devastated me when i learned he's seeing someone else.
i’ve since told him that i wanted to work things out but he’s not sure i actually mean it. he thinks the only reason i want him back is because i’m jealous.  how do i show him i’m serious?","<p>i’m sorry to hear about your current situation. my heart goes out to you during this time.</p><p>first of all, it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband, you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing. more than likely he/she will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.</p><p>secondly, you must be upfront and honest with your husband. intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling. i think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him.</p><p>if you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship, he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship. </p><p>the conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. and please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing (or lack thereof), was not your fault.</p><p>best of luck to you and your husband!</p>"
"i start counseling/therapy in a few days (i'm freaking out) but my main fear is that i'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","<p>people do cry in therapy sometimes, but it's not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful. when you start counseling you don't yet know your counselor very well, so it's normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation. sometimes, though, there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear. if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor, you might just cry in spite of your fears about it. your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality, so even though it's embarrassing, finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it. it's okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that you're kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person.</p>"
"i been having anger problems a lot lately. it only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. i use to not be like this until i got with my soon-to-be husband. i think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot. i don't get nearly as bad as he does, but i yell almost constantly and i can't seem to just stop. i have two young babies that have to hear this, and i don't want my girls growing up with a mommy like i have been lately. i just don't know how to get back to my old self.","<p>my gut says that your own rage is being triggered partly because you feel trapped or shutdown by your fiance's moody/angry/rage responses and powerless to stop it. you can start by accepting that this is who he is and you won't change him. you can only change your own behaviours, and i see you taking responsibility for those, which is great. you want to protect your girls, and that's appropriate; children are greatly affected by this type of home environment. i urge you to see a therapist so you can understand your own emotions and sort out the choices you have to make, knowing that your fiance has to make his own choices about his behaviours.&nbsp;</p>"
"i never thought i would get cancer. my family gets heart attacks, diabetes, emphysema…but not cancer.  i can’t believe this is happening to me. it’s a nightmare.","you are shocked that you got cancer. this has really turned your world upside down. you feel completely unprepared for your diagnosis and you're not quite sure how to process it. you didn't think you'd ever get cancer. cancer isn't a death sentence. follow what your oncologist says and you'll be fine. are you sure no one in your family has had cancer? whether one gets any of the diseases you mentioned, there is no moral judgement on you which ones you get. be a warrior and you have the capacity to get out of it. cancer is a big scary word. treatments have become so much more effective in recent years. try just taking it one day at a time."
i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>it can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial. since you're already going to counseling, congratulations on taking that big, first, stress-inducing step. hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist. it can be helpful to address this big ""elephant in the room"" and talk to your therapist about this. i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling, but regardless of how hard we try, sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to. the good news is, the more you keep at it, the more ""normal"" it will become.&nbsp;</p>"
"i'm not the same anymore, i don't know how to get back to who i am. i'm sad and confused and angry and tired. i don't sleep well.","<p>being tired can really affect almost everyone's ability to work through things that make them sad, confused, or angry, among other emotions. if you're having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day. also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that it's time to sleep when you are in bed. if you are not sleeping while you are in bed, consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. hopefully you'll be able to establish a pattern.</p><p>sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well. try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes.</p><p>if you're still struggling, consider talking with a therapist about the specifics and/or maybe talking with your primary care physician. there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you.</p>"

"i'm a female in my mid 20s.  lately i tend to over drink and i've become a very angry drunk. 

in the past, i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol. 

but now, even if i don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, i still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. i don't understand why i'm feeling this way. does this mean i have a problem?","<p>hello, i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. it sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" you might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.&nbsp;</p><p>i don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. the feedback i'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. &nbsp;</p><p>one of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. let me repeat that: it is a <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">disease of avoidance</span>. your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. and of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.&nbsp;</p><p>remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. if you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. for angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.&nbsp;</p><p>i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. wishing you the best health and wellness.&nbsp;</p>"
"he is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.","<p>the behaviors you describe are boundary violations.&nbsp; you can not change your spouse, but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety.&nbsp; this is very hard to do without support.&nbsp; finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful.&nbsp; if you are not ready to do this, i recommend the book ""boundaries"" by dr. henry cloud and dr. john townsend.&nbsp; it's a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive!<br></p>"
