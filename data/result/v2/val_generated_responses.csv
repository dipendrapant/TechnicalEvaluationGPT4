"well, i have just been really busy lately. i have a full-time job, and taking care of my family is my other full-time job. i really have no time for working out and eating healthy. sometimes grabbing fast food or prepared food at the grocery store is all i have to give me an extra ten minutes of sleep. at one time, i used to eat salad at every meal and i  liked that light feeling it gave me, but nowadays it is impossible to try and regulate what i am eating. we generally eat hamburgers and fries from mcdonald’s. sometimes my husband grabs a rotisserie chicken from the local grocery store. really, i am just so tired at night, and i really just don’t have the energy to cook a healthy well balanced meal.","you used to eat salad and you miss the feeling it gave you. if you had more time, you would like to feed you family something healthier. there is something about exercise and eating better than you would like in your life.
 it seems just about impossible to try to figure out a plan to getting healthy food or exercise into your routine. you think you're too busy for healthy food and physical activity. you said one of your jobs is taking care of your family, but you're not doing a very good job of that if you're feding them fast food. getting a fully cooked meal from the grocery store is a much improved alternative to fatty, high sugar, foods.  why can't you get food at the store like your husband instead of fast food? you need to put aside time for yourself. be more selfish. always look for a correct and healthy diet, don't trust fast food. thats understandable but maybe you could find some quick and easy meals to cook","I hear you and I understand that you're juggling quite a lot right now. It seems like you are under a lot of stress with your full-time job and family responsibilities. The lack of time and energy seems to be a significant barrier to prioritizing your own health and wellness. 

I want to assure you that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and it's completely normal. Many people struggle to find a balance between work, family, and self-care. However, it's important to remember that your health and well-being are crucial, not just for you, but also for the people who depend on you.

"my mother said that even though women from my country breastfeed, i am now in america, and i should try to fit in by bottle feeding.  besides, i have very small breasts and probably wouldn’t be able to make any milk.  since i want to go to college in a few months, breastfeeding seems like it would be too hard, and not worth the effort.","your mom is discouraging from breastfeeding because she wants you to fit in. you are also planning to head to college so breastfeeding might be too hard right now. it sounds like you have thought a lot about breastfeeding but you're concerned you might not produce enough milk. you think breastfeeding would be too hard. you're healthy, and have had a healthy pregnancy. i see no reason you could not produce enough milk to feed your baby, at least until you go to college. you may find that it's easier to breastfeed than it is to make bottles in the middle of the night? how do you plan to pay for formula when you're in college? yes, it is worth the effort, be dedicated and things will naturally work out, breastfeeding breasts is a maturing process. i think that it's entirely up to you. you should do whatever is best for you. breast feeding will be healthy one to child so you should try to feed the child with your milk not through bottle. breast feeding is healthy milk which every child needs till some period of time.","It sounds like you're trying to balance cultural expectations, personal concerns, and future plans, which can be challenging. Breastfeeding is a personal decision and there's no definitive 'right' or 'wrong' answer - it depends on what works best for you and your baby. 

While it's true that bottle feeding is common in America, many women also choose to breastfeed. In regards to the size of your breasts, it's a common misconception that smaller breasts produce less milk. In reality, breast size doesn't determine milk production. 

Breastfeeding can be time-consuming, especially in the beginning, but there are options to manage this. You could consider expressing milk and storing it, so others can help feed your baby when you're busy"

"about two and a half months ago, i met a woman on a dating site. we went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date. we respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. after that, i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. then one day, she went to her family’s house on thanksgiving and everything changed. within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. we had finally found each other. we told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. a few days after thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. i was very hurt and didn’t understand. then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. i was crushed!

a few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. so for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. she had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. she doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. i know she needs time, and all i can do is take care of myself. we have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn’t work out for her, we will try again. i’m completely in love with her, and i’m in extreme pain.","<p>love doesn't hurt.</p><p>your description of the relationship so far, is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain, alongside a deep attraction for this woman.</p><p>in some relationships, the benefit of what draws us together with someone, is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are, what we value and care about.</p><p>this sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one. &nbsp;</p><p>your descriptions are of the woman's life, parenting and relationship dilemmas, not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long term.</p><p>try distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday life.</p><p>being aware of how much love you'd like to give and receive, is valuable self-knowledge.</p><p>your ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you, being the result of the woman's choices, sounds like the opposite of love.</p><p>the relationship is very useful as an access in self-understanding of your needs and wishes. &nbsp;it sounds like this is its main value in your life, not that it is sustainable in reality.</p><p>good luck!</p>","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this.

"i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. whenever i get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. while a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare i can’t get to the bottom of. i’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush. what could be the reason behind this? is it massive nerve problems? is it a fear of a bad relationship?

""semi-relationship"". what does it mean? i know that today's culture for young people is more of a ""hook-up"" culture than a dating one. maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. that makes me feel sad. i hear a lot of young women (i'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. i think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.</p><p>this is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.</p><p>maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: what am i afraid of? what is the worst thing that might happen here? then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?</p><p>then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and i bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. a big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. in the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. but this doesn't work for you! good! with the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.</p>","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

What you're experiencing sounds like a deep philosophical and existential question that many people wrestle with. The existence of God and the nature of reality are subjects that have been debated by philosophers, theologians, and scientists for millennia. The truth is, there's no definitive answer that can satisfy everyone because beliefs about God are largely personal and subjective. 

However, your feeling that everyone is lying may be a symptom of something deeper. It could be related to trust issues, paranoia, or it might be a symptom of a mental health condition.

Firstly, when you say ""he was on her more than me"", it suggests you might have felt neglected or less desirable, which can evoke feelings of emptiness. While your conversation with your husband afterwards might have assuaged your concerns momentarily, the anticipation of a possible future encounter might be reigniting these insecurities.

It's important to remember that I can't provide a definitive answer about whether your ex-boyfriend is using again, as I don't have direct information about his behaviors and feelings.

Opiate addiction can certainly impact a person's behavior and mental health. It can lead to mood swings, depression, anxiety, and difficulty in maintaining relationships. It can also lead to dishonesty as the person might try to hide their use. Additionally, when an individual is in the throes of addiction, they may isolate themselves from loved ones to avoid judgment or confrontation.

"how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have?  what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? i've read about this online, but i'd like to understand this from a therapist's point of view.","<p>this is a great question, and i am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach. when i am determining what type of personality a client has, i take my time and really absorb their lens/ point of view to themselves and others. determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and building rapport. after taking time to get to know them, and learning about their view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pick-up on more specific personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. clinicians, including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent, which indicate a type of personality. for example, if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning, and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the ""type a personality"".&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">in addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the dsm-5/ icd-10.&nbsp;</span></p>","As a mental health counselor, I can tell you that the process of classifying a client's personality is a complex one. It's not as simple as ticking boxes on a checklist. It involves a deep understanding of human behavior, psychological theories, and clinical expertise. However, there are some general steps and characteristics we look at:

1. **Behavioral patterns**: We look at how a person behaves in different situations, how they react to stress, their coping mechanisms, and their typical way of interacting with others.

2. **Emotional response**: This involves understanding how the person experiences and expresses emotion. Are they generally calm under pressure? Do they get angry easily? Are their emotions stable or volatile?

3. **Thought patterns**: This includes their"

that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. when we feel
connected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. however, if
we feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. </font></p><p>

comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. the only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. if you
believe that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. it sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority. </font></p><p>

telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate

absolutely anything they are not comfortable with. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, “sex
trust.” sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries. it means they

what is most important. </font></p><p>

"i'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. at the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tim's heart. he is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but i don't really believe him. 

lately, tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. he's been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. but he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. he seems really torn up about it, and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves. 

he knows that i still crush on him. he doesn't rub it in my face. he's a good guy, but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. how do i do that when the time comes? how do i support him and show him that i'm here without wanting to hook up? how do i make him feel better? he is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which i think is ridiculous.","<p>first off, i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings,&nbsp;and understanding. regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....i'm not sure if that is possible. if you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. good luck to you!<br></p>","It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, but it's wonderful that you want to support your friend during this tough time. Here are some suggestions on how you can help Tim:

1. **Listen to him**: At this stage, just being a good listener can go a long way. Allow him to express his feelings and thoughts without judgment. This will help him feel less alone and more understood.

2. **Encourage him to communicate with Sally**: If Tim is worried about the future of his relationship with Sally, it might be helpful for him to have an honest conversation with her about his fears. They might be able to come up with a plan together, which could help alleviate some of his stress.

It's important to take a step back and consider why you are doing these sports.

what can i do to stop grieving my mother’s death?  when i am awake i just cry every day. i don't have anyone to talk to. i need help; i am still cry over her.  will i ever stop crying? it’s been 3 years.,"<p>i am sorry that you lost your mother. that is a really hard thing for someone to go through.</p><p>there is really no set time for grief to be over, but i agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief.  i do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job, but i would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help.  for one thing, bills have to be paid.</p><p>there are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order.  you can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages. </p><p>at first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone.  this may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.</p><p>then comes bargaining, in which you may beg god that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever. </p><p>depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss.  it sounds like you are stuck in this phase.</p><p>finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.</p><p>when we lose someone we never forget them.  we may always have certain days that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one.  but we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable, and that life goes on.</p><p>a therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it.  one suggestion i have is not to try to run from the sad feelings, don’t try to not feel them.  embrace the feelings.  let the feelings wash over you and accept them.  trying not to feel something is not going to help.  sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does.  unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.</p><p>i am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now.  you deserve to be happy and to live a full life.  i am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long.  i wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief.</p>","I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

If you stop using it without a suitable substitute, it could lead to worsening symptoms. However, the bad taste you're experiencing can be managed. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Rinse your mouth with water immediately after using your inhaler.
2. Brush your teeth after using the inhaler.
3. Try eating a piece of hard candy or chew gum after using the inhaler.

I would highly recommend discussing this with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen. They may be able to suggest alternative medications that have a more agreeable taste or other methods to manage the taste."

Suboxone and Vicodin both affect the central nervous system and can have strong effects when used together.

"i smoked throughout my previous pregnancy, and it was fine – both me and the baby were fine. i don’t feel it is a problem i should focus on.","since you smoked during your last pregnancy and your first baby was born healthy, you feel like smoking during this pregnancy isn’t an issue. there's absolutely no reason for you to quit smoking right now. you smoked during your last pregnancy so smoking during this pregnancy doesn't feel like a problem. your child is still too young to know what the long-term effects are of you choosing to smoke during your previous pregnancy. let me tell you why it's bad for you and your babies health. do you know the long-term impacts your child may experience from having a mom who smokes? wrong and you know very well what you did was wrong, don't repeat that, your life is also your child's and no longer yours. saying ""i did it and was fine"" is no excuse. there is ample research out there that it is harmful. i'm sure your doctor can help you find a way to cut back or quit that is safe for both you and the baby. i'm sure it was fine but you don't realize the underlying impacts it might have for the future. maybe to you everything was okay but what will happen down the line. most people only see what's on the surface but the most damaging effects happen on the inside, physically and emotionally.","I understand that you might feel this way, especially since your previous experience didn't result in any noticeable negative outcomes. However, it's vital to understand that every pregnancy is unique and the lack of complications in your previous pregnancy doesn't guarantee the same in your current or future pregnancies. 

Smoking during pregnancy can lead to complications, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, and even sudden infant death syndrome. Even if these outcomes are not guaranteed, the risk is significantly increased. 

Moreover, it's not just about the physical health of your baby. Smoking can also affect your child's mental and behavioral development. Some studies have suggested links between maternal smoking and attention disorders, as well as lower cognitive abilities in children.

It sounds like you're dealing with two main issues: a lack of physical desire, potentially due to your birth control, and an instinct to push your boyfriend away when he shows affection.

Regarding your birth control, hormonal changes can certainly affect your sex drive. It's a common side effect that many women experience. If it's distressing for you, it's important to discuss this with your healthcare provider who can guide you on possible solutions.

As for pushing your boyfriend away, this could be connected to various things. It could be related to the decrease in your sex drive, making you less responsive to physical affection. Alternatively, it may be a subconscious reaction related to past experiences, fears, or insecurities"

"i was having a sexual relationship with a coworker. he decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend. before i got paid, i told him i would have $25.00, which i thought i would. but when i saw my paycheck, i could not pay the $25.00. he says i lied to him about it. he wants me to reimburse him $25.00 for the hotel room he decided to get. he stayed at the hotel, and i left. i don't think it's right that he want me to reimburse him $25.00 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place. he is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me i am a liar and that i should never said i was going to have $25.00 when i knew i wasn't. i told him i had to pay rent and my rent was late. he texted me saying i need to get two or three jobs.","hello, and thank you for your question. it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the $25.00. if you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him, then pay when you can. i am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over $25.00. i know that it can be a lot of money if you don't have much, but that doesn't give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts. you may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner. <br><br>be well,<br><br>robin j. landwehr, dbh, lpcc, ncc<br><p><br></p>","I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation.

However, it's also important to consider the nature of your relationship with your coworker. It sounds like he's becoming quite demanding and is not understanding of your financial situation.

1. **Seek professional help**: It can be really helpful to talk with a professional therapist or counselor, both individually and as a couple. They can provide guidance, strategies, and tools to help navigate through this difficult time.

2. **Open communication**: Express your feelings and thoughts to your husband about what has happened. This must be done in a non-blaming, non-accusing way. While it is difficult, try to speak from your own perspective, using ""I"" statements, like ""I feel hurt"" instead of ""You hurt me"

First and foremost, I would suggest seeking professional help to ensure your safety and well-being. Contact your local social services agency and explain the situation. They may be able to provide resources, such as respite care, which can give you a break and help you manage stress.

"i've worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it.

i'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?","<p>it sounds like a tricky situation. if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him, getting over him may not be possible. what makes it even trickier is that his actions (hugs and touching) may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible. some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light. if you truly want to force yourself to get over him, cutting contact&nbsp;or setting strict boundaries may be necessary. if you don't see him, over time you can begin to forget about him. if you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches, you will not feel mislead or&nbsp;have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested.&nbsp;it would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings&nbsp;to change. thus, being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him. good luck!&nbsp;<br></p>","It sounds like you're in a tough situation and it's understandable that you're feeling confused and hurt.

As a mental health counselor, I can provide some advice regarding the psychological aspect.

1. Open communication: Open, honest conversation is important, especially when it comes to serious matters. The girls should ideally know about the situation, but how the information is delivered is crucial. It's important to approach this conversation in a way that doesn't cause them unnecessary harm or distress.

Bullying is completely unacceptable and you should not have to endure it. When teachers and school staff don't intervene, it can feel very isolating but there are still things you can do:

1. **Confide in Someone:** It's important to talk about your feelings with someone you trust, whether it's a parent, friend, relative or even a counselor like me. Sharing your experiences can help you feel less alone and they might be able to provide some good advice or support.

2. **Document Every Incident:** Keep a record of each bullying incident, including the date, time, location, people involved, and what exactly happened. This documentation can be useful when reporting the bullying"

Smoking during pregnancy can have serious effects on your baby's health, even if you don't feel any immediate changes yourself. According to research, smoking is linked to premature birth, certain birth defects, and infant death. Even secondhand smoke can be harmful to your baby.

"my fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. she has had it most of her life. her anxiety in public places is the worst. it gets to points where she can't breathe or move. sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. she won't eat or drink in public. if she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her. she is so scared that i can't even get her to drive. she doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.

some people have recommended medication, but i believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. i don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. when we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. she took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. she slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. i am worried and want to help her without medication.","<p>it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, won't be able to resolve her mental health issues. based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical and/or psychiatric evaluation. whether or not she decides to take medication is her (and your) decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. you would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couple's therapy, in order to address how you are feeling and&nbsp;best learn how to support her and your relationship. i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later.</p>","I'm really sorry to hear about what your fiancée is going through.

A psychiatric service dog could be a good option. They are specially trained to help individuals with mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. They can be taught to perform specific tasks that can help reduce anxiety attacks and depressive episodes.

"sometimes i can't stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. 
when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. 
am i crazy? i don't think these thoughts are normal.","<p>religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic, and these types of questions, especially around heaven, hell, and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult &amp; confusing feelings. what i want to focus on is the fear &amp; anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions. scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they're out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but i want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic &amp; anxiety.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: georgia, times, 'times new roman', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. i also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. so, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen, he wrote the book buddha's brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. there are reasons that our brain works this way, but i don't have time to go into all of that in this response. so, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, &nbsp;this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.&nbsp;i would also suggest when you're having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how you're breathing. often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full, deep breath or what is called belly breathing. if you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths, bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale, just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins. </span></p>","It's important to understand that you are not crazy. It is completely normal to ponder about life after death, as this is one of the deepest existential questions we humans grapple with. Many people from various religious backgrounds struggle with the concept of eternity, and the feelings of overwhelm and anxiety that you're experiencing are not uncommon.

The concept of eternity can feel overwhelming because it's something that's beyond our human comprehension. We are used to the concept of time having a beginning and an end. It's also important to remember that it's perfectly okay to have doubts, questions, and fears about the teachings you grew up with.

"i am always arguing with my father. he gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. i get upset often at this. am i too sensitive? he always says i am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. no matter how often i try to tell him this, he never listens.","<p>thanks for the question. regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. when we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. it sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. begin your statements with&nbsp;""i"" as opposed to ""you."" for example, you can tell him, ""i feel angry when&nbsp;you raise your voice at me"" instead of ""you&nbsp;always yell at me."" also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. maybe he just doesn't know how to.&nbsp;lastly, when delivering a message, i like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion&nbsp;with something postive and ending it with something postive. for example, you may say something to the effect of:</p><p>""dad, i&nbsp;enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. there are times that&nbsp;i feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when i bring up heated topics. let's try and work on this together. i will try to be less sensitive and i am asking that you be more calm.""</p><p>i hope you find this useful!<br></p>","It sounds like you are in a challenging situation. It's important to remember that being affected by someone's tone or behavior doesn't necessarily mean you are too sensitive. Everyone has their emotional boundaries and it's completely normal to feel upset when they are crossed. 

Also, it's not uncommon for people under stress, like your father, to unintentionally communicate their discomfort in a way that can be hurtful to others. It doesn't make it right, but it does happen. 

It's important to also remember that communication is a two-way street, and understanding often requires both parties to make an effort. Here are a few suggestions that might help you:

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?,"<p>yes, feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy, is completely normal.</p><p><br></p><p>therapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone. &nbsp; the person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions. &nbsp; for some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>in general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people who've faced problems similar to yours.</p><p>in this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handling.</p><p>no therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourself.</p><p>once you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person, your nervousness will start to disappear all on its own.</p><p>good luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions!</p>","Yes, it is completely normal to feel nervous or shaky when you go to therapy, especially if you are new to it. It can be intimidating to open up about your feelings and experiences to someone new. Remember, therapy is a process and it takes time for you to feel comfortable. It's okay to share these feelings with your therapist too - they can help you to navigate through them. Over time and with more sessions, you may find that these feelings lessen. However, if they persist and become a barrier to your therapy, it might be worth discussing alternative therapeutic approaches with your therapist."

However, I've been programmed with a vast amount of information on the subject. I understand that quitting smoking can be a very challenging process due to the addictive nature of nicotine. It often requires a lot of willpower, support, and sometimes professional help. It's important to remember that everyone's journey to quit is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. If you're trying to quit, I would encourage you to seek out resources and support to help you through this process."
why bother? the other family in our house won’t put a tv timer on their tv and our kids just go to the living room to watch with them.,sharing living space and trying to set boundaries at the same time can seem nearly impossible when the other family isn’t on the same page. finding a balanace between your family's rules and the other family's rules is a huge struggle. you can't control what the other family does. try talking to the other mom to see if you can agree on tv time. have you tried telling your kids not to go into the living room? see what is healthier and that is a more united family. maybe you could discuss the tv timer with the other family and come to an agreement. so control your kids. it's not their responsibility to limit what they do in their own time because of your kids,"It seems like you're feeling frustrated and perhaps a bit helpless about the situation. It's understandable that you have concerns about your children's screen time, especially if it's affecting their routines or behaviors. 

Good communication is key in resolving such issues. Talk to the other family about your worries and see if you can come to a compromise that works for everyone. Maybe suggest specific hours for TV watching or a mutual agreement on suitable programs. 

Remember that it's also important to provide alternatives for your children. Encourage them to engage in other activities like reading, playing games, or outdoor activities. This can help them understand that while television is okay sometimes, there are other enjoyable ways to spend their time.

2. **Reach Out to Supportive People**: Surround yourself with friends and family who can provide emotional support. It's okay to lean on others during this difficult time.

3. **Practice Self-Care**: Make sure you're eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep,"

"i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. i had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. i am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend.  they also have a daughter together. my issue is that there is always drama. i am pregnant, and i told my ex-boyfriend that i don't want any drama or arguments. i want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. however, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. that led to an argument. i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter. my stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. i especially told him i didn't want to be involved. somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.

the point is there is so much drama. i try my best to get along with everyone. i don't understand where i went wrong (besides replying back to his question). i feel like i'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. i had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. in my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. i was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which i have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","<p>hi. i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.&nbsp;children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they don't like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. your ex-boyfriend&nbsp;seems more focused on his own needs. in fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on 'parental alienation'. i agree this is a problem.</p><p>i also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. it's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. honour this instinct you have.&nbsp;</p><p>i will suggest a few things to you. first, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. it will help you feel supported.</p><p>know that your ex's behaviours aren't happening because you did anything wrong; it's the way he operates (and maybe this is why you're not with him?). you can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. you're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.</p><p>keep on defining clear boundaries! you might sound like a broken record (""you'll have to talk to my husband about that""), but that's okay. it's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. it's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. it's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. it's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.</p><p>regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing (""our agreement states x, and you are not following our agreement""). your daughter doesn't have to be aware; i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.</p><p>a professional therapist can help you with all of this. i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)</p><p><br></p>","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a very complex and stressful situation. I believe it's important to remember you cannot control other people's actions or reactions, but you can control your own. It would be helpful to set clear boundaries with your ex-boyfriend. If the communication becomes hostile or emotionally charged, it may be best to disengage and revisit the conversation when things have calmed down.

It's concerning to hear that your ex-boyfriend is using your daughter as a means to manipulate or exert control over you. This is not fair to you or your daughter. It may be helpful to consider involving a mediator or legal counsel to help navigate these difficult situations, especially if threats are being made.

what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?","talking to a licensed profession who can discuss this in greater depth can be best.&nbsp;<div>as a general information, in short, i can say that our thoughts are greatly influenced&nbsp;by our early life experiences. our thoughts are processed through schemes, these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us. &nbsp;while our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults, however, we are not condemned to abide by them for life, in psychotherapy, you learn to change negative&nbsp;schemas with positive ones. yeah, if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to self-sabotage your efforts for success and happiness. the research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind. on the other hand, in psychotherapy you can learn helpful&nbsp;strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits.&nbsp;</div><div>yoga, meditation, and tai&nbsp;chi are also found to increase self-awareness and lessen the intrusions of negative self-judgment on one's&nbsp;psyche.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div></div>","I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life."
