5566fab2a64752d71ec3ca69,Escalating disagreements between mother and wife,"my wife and mother are having tense disagreements. in the past, they’ve had minor differences. for example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.
however, it’s intensified lately. i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. what can i do?",https://counselchat.com/questions/escalating-disagreements-between-mother-and-wife,Family Conflict,"Kristi King-Morgan, LMSW",https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw,"<p>what you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. you have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>this is often seen in families. it's seen everywhere. how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? it is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. for example, i bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>i'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. that's what therapists do every day! sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. however, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>if you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. i heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. if your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. from your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. if you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. i am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. </p><p>regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. they will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. in worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>",0,"It sounds like you're in a challenging position, caught in the middle between your wife and your mother. It's important to address this situation carefully as it involves the people closest to you.

First, it might be helpful to have individual conversations with both your wife and your mother. Aim to understand their perspectives and feelings without judgment. It's essential to communicate that you're there to listen and understand, not to take sides or solve the problem immediately.

When you speak with them, try to express your feelings about the impact of their disagreements on you and the family atmosphere. Let them know that you value both of them and that it's important for you to maintain a peaceful and respectful environment at home.

Encourage open communication between them, perhaps facilitating a"

Quitting smoking is a challenging journey, especially when the habit is tied not just to a physical addiction but also to mental and emotional routines.

Firstly, it’s important to acknowledge that the urge to smoke is both a physical and psychological habit. The mental aspect, where you find yourself thinking about smoking, can be particularly tough to manage. Here are a few strategies that might help you:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Keep a journal to note down when the cravings hit you the hardest. Is it during stress? After meals? During breaks at work? Understanding these triggers can help you prepare and create new routines"

it all started when she went to missouri to visit her family. the first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. that's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. i thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.
then she told me to come to her in missouri. so that's what i did. i quit my job i dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.
once i got there everything was fine again.  she apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me.

soon after, i experienced a miscarriage. i texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. i was extremely hurt by this. i still decided to move back as i had originally planned. he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him. during this time, i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know. although he says he did, i hardly ever see him. he never got a job, which was in the original plan.  

after that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. once we got back together, i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in. i thought he had too. but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman. in fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. when i confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. i don’t know what to do.",https://counselchat.com/questions/when-should-i-give-up-on-a-relationship,"Relationships,Domestic Violence",Danielle Alvarez,https://counselchat.com/therapists/danielle-alvarez,"<ol></ol><p>there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with:</p><ol><li>several breakups </li><li><span>not holding up his end of the bargain regarding work</span></li><li><span>lack of empathy for your miscarriage</span></li><li><span>lying about his involvement with another woman</span></li><li><span>physical violence, which is of most concern. </span></li></ol><p>this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. in my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, “is this really someone i want to marry? is he an asset to my life?” i think you’ll realize he is not.</p><p>best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect.</p>",0,"I'm really sorry to hear about everything you've been through in your relationship.

when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned. i was happy but i couldn't help feeling disappointed too.
i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldn't help how i was feeling.
we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds.  i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted.
i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding. what i wanted will never happen.
i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset.
i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just can't control it. it's ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it. plus, i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed.

Hearing that you're attractive can be a positive affirmation of your physical appearance, yet it's perfectly normal for that not to automatically translate into confidence in all social interactions, especially in romantic contexts.

Building confidence in approaching someone you're interested in often involves addressing your fears or beliefs about potential rejection or inadequacy. Remember, confidence grows with practice and experience. Start with small, manageable steps. For instance, you could begin by making brief, casual conversations with people you feel less intimidated by. Gradually, as you become more comfortable with these interactions, you might find it easier to approach those you are more interested in.

The feelings of fear and the reluctance to open up are natural responses to your past hurt. It's as if you're trying to protect yourself from being vulnerable to prevent any future pain. However, this can also lead to isolation and prevent you from experiencing genuine connections and support from those around you.

Since the anger and self-harm are affecting you regularly, it might be helpful to explore these feelings with a professional who can provide you with tailored strategies to manage and understand your emotions better. These feelings can sometimes be linked to underlying issues that aren’t immediately apparent, even in seemingly ideal circumstances like a supportive family environment."

two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. i'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. despite the age difference, i know we're a really good match. we've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. i tell him everything. also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. he’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. that summer, i told him i didn't want anything serious and broke it off. only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. i'm sure she may be different around him, but i worry about him committing to her in the long run. they're supposed to move in together soon. but still, i feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and i feel like he does too.

i want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but i don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. if he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. if my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. on one hand, i want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. where would i go from there? on the other hand, i feel like i can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but i don't want to.

5664cec20901991a77b2088e,I lie to my mom about my relationship.,"i use to be so happy. no matter what, i always was happy. i got into a relationship with this guy. i love him so much. we’re both teenagers. the week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. it broke me. he came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her.",https://counselchat.com/questions/i-lie-to-my-mom-about-my-relationship,"Relationships,Family Conflict",Lynda Martens,https://counselchat.com/therapists/ms-lynda-martens-london-ontario,"<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;"">hi los angeles, i can tell you have a moral backbone because it's hurting you to lie to your mom. i always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be. listen to that voice. you don't have to lie to your mom to get what you want.</p><p style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;"">now, you don't say how old you are, so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague. there's a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do. the thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you're small, and they're supposed to, very gradually, give that control over to you. different parents do this at different speeds, but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust...it's not just gonna be handed over to you.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;"">you might not like this part...your parent has the right to make the rules. my guess is there's a reason why mom is holding you back. even if it doesn't make sense to you, breaking her rules isn't going to get you what you want...which is freedom, right? i guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom...but she's not supposed to give it to you until you're ready because her first job is to keep you safe.<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">&nbsp;i like that your mom has limits for you. too many parents are sort of looking the other way, busy with their own thing. whether you know it or not, you need protection like all kids do (appropriate for your age, of course).</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">it sounds like what you want to say to your mom is ""i want to make my own decisions about who i spend time with"". that's a normal wish, and i encourage you to say that to her. depending on your age and whether you've earned it, she might listen.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;"">so, you're sending her that message that you want to send, but you're doing it in a sneaky way, and that's not going to go well when she finds out. it's called ""passive aggressive"" when you say something with a sneaky behaviour rather than with words. it's not a very healthy way of sending a message, because people feel disrespected.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'open sans', helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;"">my guess is that your best bet is to be honest with mom, stop the sneaking around and come up with a detailed plan of how you're going to earn your freedom...eventually. she might listen to that.</p>",0,"It sounds like you’re going through a really challenging time right now. Feeling torn between your feelings for someone you care about and the expectations or rules set by your mom can be incredibly stressful. It’s clear you have strong feelings for this person, and having to navigate these restrictions can feel very limiting and painful.

It’s important to consider the reasons why your mom might have set these rules. Sometimes, parents set boundaries they feel are in the best interest of their children, even though they might be hard to understand or accept. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about how you’re feeling. Expressing your emotions and discussing why you value this relationship might provide her with a better understanding of your perspective, and perhaps there"
5566f9a2a64752d71ec3ca67,I’ve suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about 3 years,"it takes me a long time to fall asleep; i’d estimate about two hours. i often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.

i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. i was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.

after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. however in the past couple months, i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. how can i solve this issue?",https://counselchat.com/questions/i-ve-suffered-from-insomnia-and-nightmares-for-about-3-years,Sleep Improvement,Ben Braaksma,https://counselchat.com/therapists/ben-braaksma,"<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

The feelings you're describing—such as not feeling like you belong, missing your home country intensely, and experiencing significant changes in your mood and behavior—can indeed be symptoms of culture shock. Culture shock often includes stages of honeymoon, frustration, adjustment, and acceptance.

i have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before. i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship.

When trust is broken, either through infidelity or dishonesty, it creates a lot of emotional turmoil and insecurity. It’s also concerning to hear that your partner reacted to your honesty with threats and name-calling, which can be emotionally damaging and is not a healthy response.

Regarding your question about why you might still make choices that you later regret, it's important to consider that sometimes, when people feel unhappy or"

It's important to acknowledge your feelings and the complexity of the situation. Divorce can be incredibly challenging for everyone involved, and when children are in the picture, those challenges can become even more pronounced. Your partner's distress over his children's experiences and his ex-partner's actions is understandable. It’s also valid for you to feel overwhelmed and unsure about your place in all"

""what can i get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. if a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). so, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. not all kids steal, but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point. it's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out.&nbsp;</p><p>stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and i'm not surprised he lied about it. if you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. it's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. the behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>it's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). it's a dilemma. if you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. that gives him incentive to come to you with truth. it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. put a cookie on the counter. tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. then ask them later if they took the cookie. you're making honesty fun. kids love games.&nbsp;</p><p>basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative.&nbsp;</p><p>if this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. if it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.&nbsp;</p>",0,"I’m sorry to hear about the challenges you’re facing with your son.

One strategy could be implementing consistent, clear consequences that focus not just on punishment but also on learning and personal growth.

It’s important to prioritize your emotional well-being in this situation. Reconnecting with someone who has deeply hurt you might not be beneficial to your mental health or emotional stability.

It's not uncommon for anxiety and the symptoms associated with OCD to intensify during periods of change or stress, such as moving in with your boyfriend or questioning significant aspects of your life like your career and relationships.

The feelings of discomfort you're experiencing around your boyfriend, despite there being no apparent reason, could also be influenced by your OCD. Sometimes, OCD can cause intrusive thoughts or excessive doubts about aspects of life that were previously secure and comforting. It's important to recognize that these feelings might be symptoms of your condition rather than reflections of your true feelings towards your relationship.

When approaching this sensitive topic, it might be helpful to express your decision with empathy and respect, acknowledging the complexity of her situation. Here’s a way you might frame your conversation:

1. **Acknowledge Her Feelings**: Start by recognizing her desire to be involved, “I can see how much you love [child’s name] and want to spend time with him/her.”

2. **Express Your Concerns Gently**: You might say, “We"

Gender identity can be complex and unique to each individual. It's important to remember that there's no one right way to feel or be. Some people have a clear sense of their gender identity from a young age, while others might find it more fluid or evolving over time.

If you're thinking you might be transgender but don't necessarily feel like you've had ""the mind of a girl,"" it might help to explore what gender identity means to you personally.

""when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that you're hiding something. i need openness"". if they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. what is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? when you have your data recorded, read on...</p><p>the first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). this may be true if what you wrote down is ""they didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. i'm just scared and suspicious"". that's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. i can trust.""</p><p>if what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.</p><p>the third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. i'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. if this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you.&nbsp;</p><p>i hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>",0,"It's great that you're looking to understand your feelings better.

56b30469c2bfe0f729d6e74e,My husband was lying about drinking again.,"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.
the other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.

Firstly, it’s important to remember that social media platforms like Facebook often portray an idealized version of life that may not accurately reflect reality. People tend to share their happiest moments, which can create a skewed perception that everyone else is living perfect lives. It's okay if your path is different—it doesn't make your experiences any less valuable or your achievements any less significant.

Recognizing this pattern is an important first step in making a change.

""that person looked at you funny. you're strange looking"". well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person's face, and it's unlikely it had anything to do with you.&nbsp;</p><p>for you personally, your thoughts are about the afterlife...about living forever. what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? what would the worst part be? a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. it might be that you have no <span style=""font-style: italic;"">control </span>over who you are or where you go. it might be that you fear going to hell because you're ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">bad</span>"". search for that deepest fear.</p><p>i invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. it's a heavy glass, and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it, it would get in the way; you'd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. that's what's happening now. i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you're having; we all have random silly thoughts that usually aren't true. the problem is how long you're holding it in your hand. you could have that thought (pick up that glass) a hundred times a day and, as long as you put it right back on the shelf, it's not a problem. the trick is to get it back on that shelf.</p><p>right now, you're using distraction to do this. you're trying to focus on other things around you, but i think the glass is still in your hand. it's not enough; you're looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf. &nbsp;and the key is in your thoughts. once you find out what fear is trying to tell you, then you can ""talk back to"" fear. so, as an example, if fear is saying to you ""you have no control over anything"", then you can work to accept the pieces you don't have control over, learn to tolerate that feeling, and claim back the pieces you can control. you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over.&nbsp;</p><p>with a therapist you can learn to ""refute"" fears' ideas. you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear's lies and gain back control over your thoughts. i wish you the best!</p>",0,"It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the concept of eternity, especially when it relates to life after death—a topic that can be both profound and unsettling.

Here are a few steps that might help you manage your anger more effectively:

""mom...i see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen. can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want?"" sell it as ""win-win"". then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">the first part is stuff that's your business and your business alone: things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships and hygiene.... mom's voice has no place in these arenas, unless you are storing food in your room and it's a health hazard. this is a ""mom says nothing about"" list.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>the second part is about what mom needs from you. what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. does she want you to contribute to rent? buy your own food? do your own laundry? what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom? how will these things be enforced? what will happen if you don't follow through? write it all down so it's really clear. it has to all be mutually agreed upon.</p><p>the third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you, and how you talk to her. you can let her know that you don't want to be told what to do or when to do it; that doesn't work when you're 20 years old. listen to what she wants too. beyond the contract you've just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, it's optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, you'd be more willing to help out. and, i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. go for the win-win.&nbsp;</p><p>i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom. :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,"It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated and maybe a bit stifled by your mom’s behavior. It can be really challenging when you feel that you’re not being treated according to your age, especially by someone as important as a parent. It might help to find a calm and collected time to express your feelings to your mom. You could let her know how you feel when she treats you in a certain way and discuss how you might work together to improve communication. Remember, it’s important to approach the conversation with an open mind and try to understand her perspective too, as this can facilitate a more productive dialogue. What do you think might be behind her actions? Sometimes, understanding the underlying reasons can also make these situations easier to navigate."

outcomes.",https://counselchat.com/questions/what-do-i-do-when-i-have-anxiety-attacks,Anxiety,"Todd Schmenk, M.S., M.Ed.",https://counselchat.com/therapists/todd-schmenk-m-s-m-ed,"<p>the other two post answers to your question are very good and i don't feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well, but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks. &nbsp;chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event, the chain of events ((links) that lead up to the behavior - in this case a panic attack, and then what the consequences were. &nbsp;see the illustration below:</p><p><img

Exploring the root of your anxiety with someone like a counselor can be very beneficial. They can help you understand where your fears are coming with and also provide strategies to manage them.

Feeling light-headed, sweaty, and having trouble breathing are common symptoms of anxiety, especially in situations like public speaking or being in large crowds where you might feel overwhelmed or on the spot. 

Have you found anything that helps you manage these feelings a bit, even if just slightly? Sometimes, grounding techniques or focused breathing exercises can be helpful in managing these intense moments. We can explore these strategies together, or find other ways that might help make these situations more manageable for you. How does that sound?"

Hearing someone say they don’t love you, particularly a partner, can be deeply painful and unsettling. It's clear you care a lot about preserving your family and finding a way to improve communication.

In situations like this, it might be helpful to explore a few different approaches. First, it’s important for both partners in a relationship to feel heard and valued. It might be beneficial to have a calm, honest discussion about how these arguments and words make you feel. Expressing your feelings can sometimes help your partner understand the impact of their words and actions better.

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">hello, and thank you for your question. the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you. however, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer:</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3""><br></font></p><p>

</span></span></span><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals? this is important, because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not
happy when they do that. however, if monogamy is not something you value, then
perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you. not all people want monogamous relationships, and that
is alright. finally,&nbsp;if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values. that can only be determined by you. </font></p><p>

sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is.&nbsp; from the outside, it looks like the affairs
are a way to “get even” with your husband or to feel better after an argument. this
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt. we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. perhaps the
question to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband,
is this the pattern that you want to keep? the pattern of very little sex,
argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. </font></p><p>

It’s important to address the underlying issues that are leading you to seek intimacy outside of your relationship, especially if this pattern repeats itself. Reflecting on what you feel is missing or what needs are not being met might provide some insight into your actions.

Infidelity, even under the circumstances you described, can still deeply impact the trust and the bond in your relationship. It might be beneficial to consider discussing these feelings and concerns with your partner or a therapist. Open communication can be very tough but is often the first step in healing and understanding each other better. Counseling could also provide a safe space to explore these issues and work on strategies to strengthen your relationship. What do you"

you have interests, do them. if you catch yourself thinking too hard about

When communication is strained in the way you’ve described, it can often lead to feelings of loneliness or frustration, especially when your attempts to share important aspects of your life, like your mental health, are not met with the kind of response you hope for.

One approach might be to try and have an open conversation with your mother about how you feel when your attempts to share are met with reactions that make you feel unheard or sidelined. It can be helpful to choose a calm"

It might be helpful to try and address these conflicts with your daughter in a time when both of you are calm, expressing your feelings without blame or judgment. Using ""I"" statements can be a useful way to communicate how you feel without making the other person feel defensive. For example, you might say, ""I feel hurt and unloved when we argue and call each other names. I need us to find a way to communicate where we both feel respected and"

It sounds like it's been a challenging time for you. Counseling can indeed be a helpful tool when dealing with depression and anxiety, especially since you've noticed a change in your symptoms. A counselor can work with you to explore the underlying causes of your feelings, help develop new coping strategies, and provide support and guidance as you navigate these feelings. It can be particularly beneficial to have a supportive space where you can express yourself openly and learn more about the patterns that might be affecting your mental health.

Additionally, combining medication with therapy is often considered an effective approach for treating depression and anxiety. It might be a good idea to discuss how you've been feeling lately with your healthcare provider as well"

""adult"" by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this
- the range is typically between age 13 and age 18), no one is allowed to
be in the session without the child's consent.</p><p class=""msonormal"">second, ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, but
not both.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a child.<br></p><p class=""msonormal"">third, knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;
</span>generally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the child’s sessions.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;
</span>if a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child’s
sessions.<br></p>in a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law.

",0,"It’s important for counselors to maintain a neutral and supportive role, especially in sensitive situations involving family dynamics and custody issues. The ethical guidelines for counselors emphasize the importance of impartiality and confidentiality in their practice. It would not be appropriate for a counselor to take sides with one parent over another. Instead, a counselor's role is to provide a safe and supportive environment where all parties, especially children, can express themselves without feeling pressured to align with one side.

In cases where a parent is seeking information about the other parent's visitation, it's crucial for the counselor to focus on the well-being of the child rather than being involved in legal disputes or custody battles. The counselor should ensure that any information shared by the child is used solely for the purpose"

It’s important to remember that there could be several reasons for the delay in response. Since you mentioned that you called over the weekend, it's possible that the social worker hasn't yet checked the messages from that period. Many professionals may not review their messages until they are back in the office during regular business hours.

Also, there might be other factors such as changes in policy, workload, or even changes in personnel if it has been several years since your last contact. He might also be on leave or dealing with personal issues.

The need to impress others and gain approval is a common feeling many people share, and it often stems from our natural desire for connection and acceptance. 

Sometimes, this need can be linked to our self-esteem and how we value ourselves based on others' opinions. It’s important to remember that it's impossible to please everyone, and that's okay. People's opinions are influenced by their own experiences, biases, and preferences, which are beyond your control.

The good news is that there are ways to manage and even overcome these feelings with time and practice.

One approach is to start small. You might try participating in smaller or more familiar groups where the stakes feel lower, and gradually work your way up to larger groups or more challenging situations. This can help build your confidence and comfort level over time.

Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or mindfulness can also be helpful in managing anxiety symptoms when they arise. These tools can help calm your mind and reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, making it easier to speak up.

Additionally, preparing ahead of time can make a big difference."

Feeling guilt in situations like yours is very common, but it's also important to remember that your own health and well-being are just as important as your father's were. It's not selfish to take steps to protect yourself from harm, even when it comes from someone you care about. You did the best you could in a very tough situation, and sometimes, despite our best efforts, we have to make hard choices"

It's completely understandable to seek ways to cope during such a profoundly difficult time. Turning to substances like marijuana and alcohol can feel like a temporary relief, but as you might be sensing, they don't really address the deep pain you're feeling.

Grieving is a very personal process, and it can be incredibly challenging. It might be helpful to look for more sustainable and healing coping strategies. Here are a few suggestions you might consider:

1. **Seek Support:** It can be beneficial to talk about your feelings with someone who can offer empathy and understanding. This could be a therapist, a grief counselor, or a support group where you can connect with others who have experienced similar losses."

Wanting to impress others and be accepted is a natural human desire, but it can become overwhelming if it feels like it's driving most of your actions and thoughts.

Your feelings might be rooted in a fear of rejection or a deep-seated belief that your value depends on how others perceive you. It's also possible that past experiences, where you received strong positive reinforcement from impressing others, have taught you to equate success and worth with approval from others.

Addressing this might involve exploring your self-esteem and how it's tied to external validation. Reflecting on questions like, ""Who am I trying to impress and why?"" or ""What"

While it's important to respect each other’s decisions in a relationship, that respect must be mutual. It’s also crucial for both partners to feel heard, valued, and supported.

In relationships, both partners' feelings and decisions need to be respected, but this also includes your own. It's important to consider what you need and deserve in a relationship. Consistency and reliability are foundational to building trust and security between partners. It’s understandable to feel hurt if these aspects are lacking.

It’s also important to remember that you have the right to express how his indecisiveness affects you. Communication is key in these situations. Perhaps discussing your feelings openly and honestly could help him understand the impact of his actions on your well-being.

2. **Gratitude**: Keeping a gratitude journal where you write down things you are thankful for each day can shift your focus from what you lack to what you have. This practice can significantly boost your mood and sense of contentment.

Managing finances, work, relationships, children, and household duties simultaneously can indeed be overwhelming. It’s important to acknowledge the feelings you’re experiencing and to recognize that it’s okay to seek ways to manage and alleviate this stress.

One approach might be to prioritize tasks and responsibilities. Sometimes, breaking down your responsibilities into smaller, more manageable tasks can make them feel less daunting. Additionally, setting aside specific times for planning and organizing might help you feel more in control.

It's also beneficial to ensure you're taking time for yourself. Self-care isn't just a luxury; it's necessary for maintaining mental and emotional health."

Grieving the end of a relationship is a deeply personal process, and it can take a lot of time, especially when the bond was so significant. Have you been able to express these feelings to someone close to you, like a friend or family member? Sometimes sharing your thoughts and feelings can be a step toward healing.

Also, focusing on your relationship with your son can be a source of comfort and purpose. Although it’s challenging, embracing your role as a father"

It's important to address not only the symptoms but also any possible underlying issues.

Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you've been feeling, like a friend, family member, or a professional? Sometimes, having support can make a significant difference. Additionally, exploring some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or gentle physical activities, might help manage the intensity of the panic attacks.

It could be related to individual differences in the children's temperaments, variations in your life circumstances, or even the natural ebb and flow of parental emotions. Sometimes, the stresses of parenting, especially with three children of varying ages, can affect how you connect with each child.

It's understandable how distressing it can be to feel out of control with your thoughts and behaviors, especially when they lead to self-harm, like skin picking, or conflict with others.

The pattern you're describing—periods of relative calm followed by intense anxiety and disruptive behaviors—suggests there might be underlying emotional or psychological issues that need addressing. Skin picking can often be a coping mechanism for anxiety or stress, but as you've noticed, it can also exacerbate feelings of distress and self-consciousness.

What you're describing does fall into what many would consider emotional or verbal abuse.

Firstly, it’s important to acknowledge that your roommate’s drinking and her emotional dependency on you and others for reassurance and validation are significant issues. Her behavior when she’s drunk and her constant need for reassurance might be symptoms of underlying emotional distress or other mental health issues.

Here are a few strategies that might help you manage your anxiety while you're on the road:

Before you travel, plan your route, accommodations, and work schedule as much as possible. Knowing what to expect each day can help reduce uncertainty and give you a sense of control.

you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? that said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.</div><div><br></div><div>the last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. in the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. this pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""i'm sorry."" however, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. in my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""i'm sorry"", i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. if neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.?

Sometimes, the difficulty in making changes can be linked to underlying fears, unresolved issues, or not having enough support. It could also be that the goals are too broad or overwhelming, which can make it hard to know where to start or maintain momentum.

It might be helpful to break down the changes you want to make into smaller, more manageable steps. Celebrate small victories as they can motivate you to"

The possibility of moving past cheating does exist for many couples, but it depends on several factors, including the willingness of both parties to earnestly work through the underlying issues, the ability to rebuild trust, and the level of commitment to the relationship. Both of you would likely benefit from open, honest communication about your feelings, expectations, and concerns. It could also be very helpful to engage in couples counseling where a therapist can provide guidance and facilitate healing conversations.

&nbsp;once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. &nbsp;</p><p>first, if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the ""long haul"", so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again, that is completely do-able and possible if you both put in the work. &nbsp;but, there's a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. &nbsp;you say your relationship is ""good"", but there's been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. &nbsp;would you agree with that, or what are your thoughts? &nbsp;were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? &nbsp;if you are more of an emotional person than he is, you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn't been meeting your emotional needs. &nbsp;for instance, if you hadn't been feeling loved, cared about, validated, appreciated, cherished, and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. &nbsp;this is a common issue with couples, and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. &nbsp;in essence, many women tend to have more emotional needs than men, this is the way we are hard-wired, and there are exceptions to this of course, but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal! &nbsp;until he understands this, and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally, you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally (and sexually). &nbsp;this leads to you both being frustrated, but if all this is ringing true to you, he seriously probably has no clue what's going on and may not know how you're feeling. &nbsp;you need to communicate your needs to him; if you are super lost with how to do that, there's an awesome book called the five love languages. &nbsp;it's not that long, and it's very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening; really!!</p><p>this is a long post, i'm sorry! &nbsp;but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. &nbsp;so back to the second direction you can go....you feel very betrayed, you aren't sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. &nbsp;for instance, if he says he is working late, or if he doesn't call or text right away when he usually does, you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. &nbsp;of course, it may not be true, he may have legit reasons for his behaviors, but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia-mode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you, then the trust may not be able to be re-built. &nbsp;you need to think long and hard about this, and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty, then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. &nbsp;you can't just tell him vaguely ""i need to trust you again""; if he wants his family back and he's willing to do the work, you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. &nbsp;but, be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren't attracted to him anymore (or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren't meeting his physical needs)...if he throws that out there, but you weren't showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally, then it all starts with you communicating that to him. &nbsp;get that book!</p><p>in conclusion, if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he's cheating when his behavior isn't spot on, you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. &nbsp;there is certainly a way to work through this, but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. &nbsp;rebuilding trust can be a long process, maybe even years, and for some people, they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past. &nbsp;i truly recommend starting with the book, and then going from there. &nbsp;if you decide you want to stay with him, you would really benefit from couples counseling, as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again.</p>",0,"I’m sorry to hear about what you’re going through; discovering infidelity can be deeply hurtful and unsettling.

This can help reduce the impact of worrying about potential future events. When you notice a scary thought entering your mind, try to observe it without judgment and gently bring your focus back to the present moment, perhaps by concentrating on your breathing or the sensations in your body.

Another strategy is to challenge these thoughts. Ask yourself questions like: ""Is"

This process involves slowly and safely exposing yourself to the fear in a controlled way, starting with the least frightening scenario and gradually working up to more challenging situations.

Here are a few steps to consider:

You can practice this by summarizing what your partner has said and asking if you understood correctly, showing that you are engaged and care about her thoughts and feelings.

2. **Self-Reflection**: Spend some time reflecting on your own behaviors and emotions. Consider how they might be contributing to the problems in your relationship. Be honest with yourself about what you might need to change or improve.

The guilt you're experiencing after drinking, even when you don't do anything embarrassing or wrong, could be your inner self signaling that your current relationship with alcohol might not be healthy. Guilt can often arise when our actions, or the situations we find ourselves in, don’t align with our values or how we see ourselves.

The fact that you've mentioned becoming an angry drunk and previously making choices like cheating while under the influence suggests that alcohol might be impacting your decisions and emotions more than you'd like. This can indeed be an indication of a problem, especially if your drinking leads to regrettable actions that don't reflect"

(an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. in this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.</p><p>i have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that i learned years ago during graduate school: ""not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist."" it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients. the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. in these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.</p><p>ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. if both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.</p>",0,"Deciding when to end counseling sessions or to terminate the therapeutic relationship with a client is a significant decision and involves several factors, all centered around the client's well-being and progress.

1. **Goal Achievement**: One of the primary indicators for terminating therapy is when the client has achieved the goals set at the beginning of the therapy. These goals are often revisited and revised throughout the process to ensure they remain relevant to the client's needs.

2. **Stability and Improvement**: Counselors look for signs that the client has not only made improvements in their presenting issues but also has gained the skills and strategies needed to cope with future challenges independently.

58c61c9598741803743bf6cb,How does someone approach a counselor?,how does a person start the counseling process?,https://counselchat.com/questions/how-does-someone-approach-a-counselor,Counseling Fundamentals ,"Shawn Thomas Berthel, M.S., LMHC",https://counselchat.com/therapists/shawn-thomas-berthel-m-s-lmhc,"<p>hello. counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. that said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. the counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.</p><p>once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. that first session is often very low key. there might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. this document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. all of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.</p><p>in the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. it's true. we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. what makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together.&nbsp;</p><p>part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. we honestly do not, plain and simple. counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. so as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy.</p>",0,"Starting the counseling process is a big step toward self-care, and it’s great that you’re looking into it. The process typically begins with finding a counselor who feels like the right fit for you. You might look for someone who specializes in particular areas, such as anxiety, depression, or family counseling, depending on your needs.

Once you find a few potential counselors, you might reach out to them to ask about their approach to therapy, their availability, and whether they accept your insurance or offer a sliding scale for payment. Many counselors offer a brief initial consultation, often at no charge, to see if you both feel it would be a good fit.

This includes looking at changes in behavior, emotional regulation, and the ability to manage or cope with life's challenges independently."

It provides a supportive environment where individuals can explore their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors with a trained professional. Counselors can help individuals develop coping strategies, better understand themselves and their relationships, and work through specific challenges or mental health issues.

Counseling can be particularly effective for managing depression, anxiety, relationship issues, and many other psychological concerns. It also offers a safe space to process and talk through life's challenges, which can be incredibly valuable on its own.

Each person's experience in counseling is unique, and the benefits can vary depending on numerous factors, including the quality of the relationship between the counselor and the client, the specific approaches used, and the client's engagement in the process."

2. **Develop New Coping Strategies:** Since smoking has been a mental relief, finding other ways to cope with stress or relax can be beneficial. This might include physical exercise, meditation, deep breathing techniques, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy.

word “termination,” i usually say “our goodbye.” &nbsp;under what circumstances does therapy usually

up!&nbsp; ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session. what i mean by that
is, there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently. so the first session i
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and

is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful.&nbsp; a therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
