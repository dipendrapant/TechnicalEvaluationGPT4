"the doctor told me there is a 1 in 4 chance of cystic fibrosis. i already have one affected child and i’m not having more than four total children, so my risk is done.","you’ve done the math and you’re sure that you’re at a pretty low risk for having another child with cystic fibrosis. you really want to have a big family. you love being a parent and know that you want many children. you don't think you can have more than one child with cystic fibrosis. that is not how odds or statistics work. every child has a one in four chance so you could have four children with cystic fibrosis. do you understand statistics? if the doctor says so, trust him. that isnt how statistics work, you could also have more children that are afflicted. you need to be sure there's no genetic probability involved or you're completely wrong"
"sometimes i can't stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. 
when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.

"an organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies. the study was to implant a fantasy other people are having, but to me, it's a nightmare. i lost my kids, my job, and all that. i was an unwilling participant. i no longer trust a therapist.  i'm too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything.","<p>given your experience of being imposed upon against your will, and all the personal and professional loss that has come since, your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable. there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed, however, there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause. <br></p><p>i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky, given your experiences, and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts, cope with and alleviate the stress that they create, and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves. a therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again. <br></p><p>if therapy feels too unsafe at the moment, i would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress. some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques, acceptance and commitment therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. you may even be able to find some of these resources at a library, if affordability is an obstacle.<br></p>"

"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.
the other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. 
i'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.","<p>it can be very frustrating being lied to. &nbsp;the one thing that struck me was the sentence he had a alcohol addiction ""in the past."" &nbsp;addiction is not something that comes and goes. &nbsp;once you have addict tendencies they are here to stay. &nbsp;you may be able to fight them off for awhile but the will enviably rear their ugly head again. &nbsp;some of the things that we would suggest is taking the access away. &nbsp;if the alcohol is not conveniently in the house he would have to go seek it out elsewhere. &nbsp;you can think about it in other terms. &nbsp;if chocolate cake was your favorite food and you were a diabetic, you would not have chocolate cake lying around all the time because you know you would eventually eat it. &nbsp;remember there are no temporary addicts.</p>"

is this something i should be concerned abou? any advice will help.","<p>have you asked your daughter why she's doing the behaviors you describe?</p><p>often the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reason.</p><p>her answer will give you some guidance as to next possible steps.</p><p>if she's pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels, or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problem.</p><p>ask if she's noticed any change in the way she walks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>maybe she doesn't know she's doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you she's doing something a bit odd.</p><p>since usually 12 year olds don't color, is it new that she started coloring?</p><p>maybe given the fact of messy handwriting, she's in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young child.</p><p>then this becomes the topic of examination.</p><p>does she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescence?</p><p>some of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter, which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughter's motivation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

"after first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","<p>hi. &nbsp;this is an excellent question ! &nbsp; i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist . &nbsp;in my work with people , once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress . &nbsp;i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track. &nbsp;we would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns . &nbsp;usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful . &nbsp; i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this. &nbsp;i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me."" &nbsp;i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful &nbsp;strategies, i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan . &nbsp;we the &nbsp; work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along. &nbsp; if things aren't improving , i am very happy and willing to try something new !&nbsp;</p><p>i hope this is helpful for you !&nbsp;</p>"
i am getting worried that i have not lost any weight in the past two months.  i’m wondering if maybe my metabolism has slowed.  i’m happy i lost the 15 pounds but now it seems that i can’t lose anymore. i am eating really healthy and exercising.,"you're really proud of yourself for the weight that you've already lost but starting to feel frustrated that the scale hasn't moved in a while. you're questioning why the scale hasn't moved in a while and wondering if it may be because of your metabolism. if it's ok with you, i can share a bit more about how your metabolism works.   you think your weight has plateaued. you should worry. your weight has plateaued. let's look over your food intake blog to determine where you can make changes. have you been tracking your food or calorie intake? if you are close to your target weight, do not worry. excess weight can be harmful. 15 pounds is actually fine. continue to eat healthy and exercise. losing weight in the beginning is easier, but over time it makes it difficult, don't be discouraged. it sounds as if youve hit a plateau. id suggest keep doing what you were doing previously (when you lost the 15 pounds). its easy to become complacent and slide back into old habits after seeing a good result."
"i'm a male in my 20s. my girlfriend is in her late 30s. she's great. she's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. she recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. we fight a lot. it’s mostly my fault, i must admit. she doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust i have for her. i have trust issues. also, i can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so i'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. i don't think she's happy. she's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. i love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. i never believed in the whole ""if you love them, let them go,"" but i do now. i really want her to be happy. should i end it with her? she has no place to go so i feel like i can’t break up with her. i’m literally trapped.","<p>hi fort worth, &nbsp;i applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship. &nbsp;most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you can't change her, &nbsp;what you can do, is change yourself. &nbsp;we can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings. &nbsp;that is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher. &nbsp;i wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust. &nbsp;has that ever showed up anywhere before? &nbsp;it has more to do with you and less to do with her. &nbsp; your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself. &nbsp;that is really where you want to focus. once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know. &nbsp;you are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like. &nbsp; know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself. &nbsp;the rest will take care of itself. &nbsp;finding a therapist can be a big help in this process. &nbsp;you are asking the question, so i suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror. &nbsp;i believe in you and am wishing you all the best.</p><p>sandra cooper, rn, lpcmh</p>"
"often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and i can't get it out.  how can i stop these thoughts?","<p>such a great question! i'm so sorry you are struggling! you may be experiencing intrusive thoughts. &nbsp;these are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us. &nbsp;i can strongly recommend a book called ""when panic attacks"" by dr. david burns. &nbsp;it helps you to identify the thoughts, and the help you create ways to counteract them! &nbsp;there is another technique, called thought stopping. thought stopping can be as simple as saying ""stop!"" loudly (if you are alone) or in your head, if you are in public. &nbsp;it's a quick way to distract you from the distressing thought, and allow you to refocus. &nbsp;i recommend using this technique, followed by some deep breathing, while visualizing something that helps you feel relaxed (a favorite place, a pet, etc.). &nbsp;these three things in conjunction can be of great assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>one key component in addressing anxious thinking is building the skill of relaxation. &nbsp;i recommend an app called headspace which teaches relaxation through some simple guided mediation. super easy to do, and a great way to begin to build relaxation skills. &nbsp;</p><p>plenty of sleep and reducing caffeine intake can also be things to explore. hope this helps! &nbsp;</p>"
"whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds, i freak out. i get light-headed, sweaty, and i have trouble breathing.","<p>as you do it more, it should get better or at less with less anxiety.&nbsp; anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public.&nbsp; i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years.&nbsp; i even experienced that when i first became a counselor and had to lead classes.&nbsp; i asked myself why were i so anxious?&nbsp; i admit at that time i didn't have confidence in myself.&nbsp; the more i prepared and practiced, the more my confidence level increased.&nbsp; yours will too... <br></p>"
"so have you ever had a sick child, how can you really relate to me?","you’re concerned i won’t be able to help you. you’re not sure i can understand how difficult it has been. you don't think i can relate. i do understand how difficult it is to manage the schedule and needs a child with an illness and try to maintain my own life. it's such a challenge. i know if i can manage it, then you can to. what do i need to have had a sick child in order to help you? don't put your child in a conversation, that's between you. sick kids are definitely something i have dealt with in the past. it's certainly rough and tiring. it can be heartbreaking, even if it's a simple cold. absolutely i've had plenty of sick children that i had to take care of over the years and it was never easy. i hated seeing them suffer but it's important to just stay calm and do the best you can possible do."
"my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i don't want to hear it anymore.","<p>then one day when life between you and mom feels calm, tell your mom that you aren't able to listen to her complaints about your sister.</p><p>the truth exists whether or not it is acknowledged. &nbsp; bu acknowledging what feels real and necessary in your life, you are helping your mom see what she may not like to see and what nevertheless is right in front of her.</p><p>there is no good reason or good to come of hiding your own truth about not wishing to continue listening to your mom complain.</p>"

"i am a really shy person. i'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. how can i get more confident?","<p>a good way to start is the language or ""self talk"" that is happening inside your mind. &nbsp;looking at your question, when it is said that the presentations ""make me feel stress"" you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self. &nbsp;the presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it! &nbsp; what language can you change in your self talk? &nbsp;for example, are you saying ""i can't speak in front of an audience! i'll fail?"" &nbsp;that sounds a lot different than ""i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud, i can ace this presentation!"" &nbsp;although this is a short answer, i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
"i'm a guy. if i don't like girls, nor do i like guys, does that mean i'm gay?","<p>no, it does not necessarily. &nbsp;your sexual preference is based on who you are attracted to, not what does not turn you on. &nbsp;if you find you have no sex drive at all, this is called asexual. &nbsp;but you did not mention what you do find arrousing either. &nbsp;hope this helps.</p>"

i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"<p>i suggest that you work on emotional awareness. </p><p>emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.</p><p>emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.</p><p>often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.</p><p>being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others.  being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.</p><p>many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions.  for example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness.  therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger.  being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear.  instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways.  if a man never learns to say “i am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.</p><p>you can control yourself and not explode.  walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out.  instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you.  what is the real feeling driving these outbursts?  maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. </p><p>it might help to keep an anger journal.  write down everything that gets you upset.  that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off.  talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience. </p>"

why am i so afraid of it? i don't understand.,"<p>why are you afraid of rape? because it is a problem in the united states! the national sexual violence resource center reports that one in five women (0r 20%) will be raped (http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) and that 80% of women know their assailant. given these statistics, it is perfectly logical to be afraid. however, there are things you can do to reduce the risk of rape, such as being aware of your surroundings, and limiting the use of drugs or alcohol.</p><p>the enhanced access, knowledge, act program for college-aged women has been shown to reduce the risk of rape by more than 50%. (http://www.blueprintsprograms.com/factsheet/eaaa-enhanced-assess-acknowledge-act-sexual-assault-resistance-education) you may want to see if a program like this is available in your area.&nbsp;</p><p>another great app for when you need to walk somewhere alone, is the companion app (http://www.companionapp.io). friends or family can track your progress from one point to another via the gps in your phone.</p><p>in addition, talking with a counselor about your fears would also be a good idea. sometimes fears are rational and reasonable. sometimes they are over-reactions and unreasonable. when then are over-reactions and unreasonable, they can have a negative impact on your life. in this case, a counselor could help you understand why your fears are unreasonable, and how you can stop them from negatively impacting your life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
"i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. whenever i get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. while a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare i can’t get to the bottom of. i’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush. what could be the reason behind this? is it massive nerve problems? is it a fear of a bad relationship?

while i’m not quite ready to be in one anyway, i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one. i don’t take medications and have no desire to, i have read forums, and i’ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","<p>hi helena,</p><p>i felt a bit sad when i read this. this is a new term for me... ""semi-relationship"". what does it mean? i know that today's culture for young people is more of a ""hook-up"" culture than a dating one. maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. that makes me feel sad. i hear a lot of young women (i'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. i think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.</p><p>this is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.</p><p>maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: what am i afraid of? what is the worst thing that might happen here? then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?</p><p>then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and i bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. a big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. in the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. but this doesn't work for you! good! with the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.</p>"
"i was raped repeatedly when i was younger. i told my parents and action was taken, but now that i’m an adult, i suffer from extreme anxiety.","<p>while anxiety can come about for many reasons, trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life. when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies - we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come. this is normal, natural and in many ways helpful - at least initially. this fear is in some way a sign that your body/mind is taking good care of you - trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again. however, as it sounds like you know, anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety. in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life, i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out <a href=""http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/videos-additional-therapy-resources/"">anxiety resources </a>online. &nbsp;</p>"

resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. good for you. i
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too.
</font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">first, good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">to answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other people’s actions. there are various
reasons why we do this. for one thing, someone may </font><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:&#10;normal""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">tell </font></i><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">us that their behaviors are </font><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:&#10;normal""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">our </font></i><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">fault. and depending on things like our relationship to that
person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe
it. what is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that </font><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">you</font></i><font face=""calibri"" size=""3""> are safe and
cared for, not the other way around. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">as for the other things you mentioned, i am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and well-being. it sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">you may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on. i will tell you that in some
states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services, but not necessarily. if you are concerned
about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">if you don’t know a counselor, think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to. they may have some ideas. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. you may be able
to find something like that in your state. i do warn your about doing random
searches, not every website is good, so be careful. </font></p><p>

</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 8pt;""><font face=""calibri"" size=""3"">this is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the
things that i encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself. sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy. try really hard not to let that happen. if
you have interests, do them. if you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. try to take care
of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. exercise can really help when
we get stressed. </font></p><p>

"sometimes, i'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. i've always thought it was normal and i was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself.","<p>feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes we're not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety, i. e., heart racing, sweaty palms, sweating, shortness of breath. it's important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body &amp; mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us, which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals, like adrenaline or cortisol. &nbsp;so, one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety, such as fear, stress. negative thought patterns, not enough food or sleep. keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills &amp; techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep. one quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes, sometimes this is called belly breathing. when you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates. many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath, and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress &amp; anxiety .&nbsp;</p>"

does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"i love this question! some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldn't need a counselor. however, if you are having a difficult time, counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know. for one, your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do. in that way, counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation. this gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings. a counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>over time, as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights. the work you do is based on you and where you are at. oftentimes, when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation, and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you. a counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your plan.</div><div><br></div><div>best of luck to you!</div>"
does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"<p>counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation. &nbsp;for some, this process can take a very long, winding path of self-discovery, while, for others, they are seeking a purposeful, solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. it's important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. i often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals.&nbsp;<br><br>on a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours. &nbsp;however, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication.&nbsp;</p>"
"i'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","<p>&nbsp;sexual intimacy can be very triggering for survivors even when it is both wanted and consensual. &nbsp;you may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so. often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse &nbsp;have not been fully processed. &nbsp;in the meantime, you may want to consider coming up with a safe word to let your partner know that you are being triggered or to communicate your physical boundaries to him. &nbsp;often times, the experience of communicating &nbsp;your physical boundaries to your partner, having those boundaries respected and validated, and having a partner who is understanding and &nbsp;willing to engage in intimacy in such a way that does not violate your physical boundaries &nbsp;can reinforce a sense of safety with him.&nbsp;</p>"

"i'm a teenager, and while i’ve never been to any kind of therapist, i noticed i experience several anxiety symptoms. i frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. i can't go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when i do, i have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. i also forget things a lot.","<p>with the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. i'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone &nbsp;(sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.</p><p>one thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.</p><p>as for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. when you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. it's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.</p><p>something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.</p><p>another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.</p><p>also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. during this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. for example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself ""i'm anxious right now and i'm okay"" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. no one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.</p><p>anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. if it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.</p><p>also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable.</p>"
"after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  now he is depressed and hopeless again.","<p>since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.</p><p>give yourself some time to concentrate on how you've been affected by your husband's suicide attempt. &nbsp; even if you decide against immediately telling him how you're feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.</p><p>is your husband talking easily with you?</p><p>do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?</p><p>the ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.</p><p>depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life.</p>"

"a few years ago i was making love to my wife when for no known reason i lost my erection, 

now i'm in my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent.  this is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. this has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. 

i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. i am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like i used to. 

what could be causing this, and what can i do about it?","<p>first step always is to do a medical rule out so that you're sure the problem is psychological and emotion based, not a medical condition which requires care and attention.</p><p>if you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what you're doing with your life, or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself.</p><p>often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it.</p><p>if you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wife's insecurities and self-doubt. &nbsp;if she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem, she can avoid looking at herself.</p><p>there may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem.</p><p>medicine looks for symptoms to treat.</p><p>our emotional lives are much more indirect.</p><p>if you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life.</p><p>basically, do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>you may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away.</p>"
"my husband and i have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. others have told me that most men would have left me by now. honestly, i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. i want to be better connected with my husband.","<p>i work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges. the one aspect i tell many folks that i work with, is this: every person and relationship is different. there really isn't a ""normal"" amount of sex a person should have or want to have. if having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband, there is nothing wrong with it. if you or your husband would like to have sex more often, i suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied. <br></p><p>the aspect of connectedness is an important one. while sex can be very connecting for many couples, it isn't the only way to connect. i find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex, checking in to see how you and your husband feel, as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this need.<br></p>"
we fight a lot. but i love him. my friends all say i should leave him.  they say he’s abusive. but where would i go? maybe my life would be better without him.,"you’re curious what your life would look like without him. you might make the deicison to leave if you had someplace else to go. on one hand you love him and you've built a home together. but, on the other hand, you recognize that you deserve better and should not be physically hurt by someone who claims to love you.  your boyfriend is abusive and you don't know if you should leave. you see that he's hurting you, and are considering how your life might be improved without him. i think you should consider staying at a shelter for the night while you're in this headspace. then you can think about what you might do next.  do you have any friends you could stay with? yes analyze what is best and never accept abuse. take a moment to think of what's important to you and make a decision based on those principles."
"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him.  i also was dealing with an abusive relationship (mentally, physically, and emotionally). now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people.

how can i feel more comfortable around other people?","<p>it sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma. &nbsp;it makes sense that you would feel nervous around people. &nbsp;working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process. &nbsp;and then to add on the caretaker part can make things even more difficult. &nbsp;</p><p>first off, you may want to seek support to work through what you have experienced. &nbsp;many cities offer support with survivors of domestic violence and there is a hotline to help with this 888-724-7240 as well as online resources. &nbsp;processing the isolation of this relationship as well as working with your son can help to overcome the anxiety related to others. &nbsp;accessing autism support networks may be of support as well. &nbsp;other parents that will understand your experiences are a good and tend to be safer place to start in attempting to connect to others.</p><p>very importantly, go slow and be kind to yourself as you begin to adapt to a new life of allowing others to care for you as you so clearly have for others.</p>"
how does a person start the counseling process?,"<p>most counselors are very approachable and many offer a 15 minute chat by phone to allow you to talk about your issue, and to get a feel for the counselor. &nbsp;if you like what you hear by phone, the next step is to set up a face-to-face meeting. studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor. &nbsp;trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable, let him or her know that you don't think it's a good fit. &nbsp;many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy. &nbsp;visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area.</p>"

on weekends i love having a few vikes (vicodin) and chilling.,"you look forward to using vicodin on weekends. it helps you decompress after a long week. after a busy week, you really need an outlet -- something to help you unwind.  you use vicodin on the weekends. vicodin is very addictive, and should only be used sparingly, under direct medical supervision. if you find you need them to calm down, then it sounds like there are other issues going on in your life that need addressed. do you have other ways to chill out besides popping pills? maybe you could find more natural approaches to replace this with. for example meditation, essential oils... do you know how vikes effect your body? it would be nice if you could learn how to relax without taking pills."

"about two and a half months ago, i met a woman on a dating site. we went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date. we respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. after that, i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. then one day, she went to her family’s house on thanksgiving and everything changed. within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. we had finally found each other. we told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. a few days after thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. i was very hurt and didn’t understand. then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. i was crushed!

a few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. so for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. she had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. she doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. i know she needs time, and all i can do is take care of myself. we have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn’t work out for her, we will try again. i’m completely in love with her, and i’m in extreme pain.","<p>love doesn't hurt.</p><p>your description of the relationship so far, is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain, alongside a deep attraction for this woman.</p><p>in some relationships, the benefit of what draws us together with someone, is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are, what we value and care about.</p><p>this sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one. &nbsp;</p><p>your descriptions are of the woman's life, parenting and relationship dilemmas, not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long term.</p><p>try distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday life.</p><p>being aware of how much love you'd like to give and receive, is valuable self-knowledge.</p><p>your ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you, being the result of the woman's choices, sounds like the opposite of love.</p><p>the relationship is very useful as an access in self-understanding of your needs and wishes. &nbsp;it sounds like this is its main value in your life, not that it is sustainable in reality.</p><p>good luck!</p>"

"over a year ago i had a female friend. she turned out to be kind of crazy so i decided to stop talking to her.  when she would call me i wouldn't answer the phone. this made my girlfriend really suspicious. she would ask me why i wouldn't ever answer that phone number. i told my girlfriend that i don't want to be friends with that other woman, but i don't think she believes me. how can i get my girlfriend to understand?","<p>we women <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really do</span> tend to struggle with the comparison game. and hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about.&nbsp;<br><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">it's been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. so you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. for example:</span><br></p><ul><li>where did you meet her?</li><li>how long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?&nbsp;</li><li>why don't you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by ""kind of crazy"")? i promise this tends to matter to women.</li><li>were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?</li></ul><div><br></div><div>if your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman's hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has nothing to worry about, she may start to come around.<br><br>now, if she's more concerned that you might be taking this woman's calls behind your back, while i'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.<br><br>and if you really want to step it up, i would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). &nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">bottom line</span> - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you chose her. &nbsp;and would continue to do so all over again. &nbsp;and why you love her as a person. &nbsp;this will help her trust what you're saying.&nbsp;<br><br>best of luck to you! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>tamara powell, lmhc</div>"
"i don't know what's with me. i'm almost constantly angry. even when i'm happy, i still feel anger inside me. when i acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. i get angry at the littlest things. even if i think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me. something perfectly normal can make me go off. when my anger flares up, i get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. it's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","<p>hi nashville, i'm glad you want this to be different. it doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, i'm sure.</p><p>working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. it's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that.&nbsp;</p><p>so, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). in that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.</p><p>i suggest finding a therapist to work with. you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)</p><p><br></p>"

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"<p>this is a question that is very specific to each person. there are definitely some variables, but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:</p><ul><li>when a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselor</li><li>sometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain time</li><li>sometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. this depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatly</li></ul><p>i'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. oftentimes ""discharge goals"" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things. changes are normal, but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind, at least generally, from the beginning. i strongly encourage you to ask about it!</p>"
"i’ve been on 0.5 mg of xanax twice a day for the past month. it hasn't been helping me at all, but when i take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking i'm abusing them. i just have very big anxiety attacks. should i stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose? i'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","<p>in general, xanax is very short-acting.&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">you mentioned that you are afraid that your medical provider will take you off of the xanax and put you on something else. if the xanax is not working well for you, i wonder if something else may work better. what is your reasoning there? also, sometimes there are medications that you can take in addition to xanax.</span><br></p><p>in addition to talking with your medical provider about changing the medication, try to track your levels of anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day so you can get a pattern of what is happening. also consider writing down what is happening before you have anxiety attacks. this may help your medical provider know what medication may be helpful to you or what changes could be made.</p><p>as far as how to discuss this with your medical provider, i would suggest mentioning the symptom changes you are having (anxiety attacks that are not helped with 0.5mg of xanax) and ask what they would suggest that might help. if your medical provider suggests taking you off of the xanax, i would recommend talking about the reasons why you would prefer to stay on the xanax and what your concerns are about coming off of it. you could also ask whether anything could be combined with xanax.</p><p>there are also many other anxiety medications. i have seen lots of people that take more than one medication to lessen anxiety that they are having.</p><p>i would also consider talking with a therapist (unless the person who is prescribing a medication is also doing therapy with you). getting more information about your anxiety and how it is affecting you may be greatly helpful to you.</p>"
"we have been together over a year. we spend time together every day no matter how busy. he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight. he also began to be distant and sexually selfish. we had a argument, and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer. he wont treat it.","<p>i wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want, wish for, and desire from one another right now. that doesn't necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for, but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him, since traditional medical treatment is not something he wants.</p><p>you may also consider using some open-ended questions (not yes or no answers) to talk about what you're feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship. both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one another.</p><p>i would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends (with him considering doing the same) so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone else.</p><p>it may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones.</p>"

"my husband won’t support the program, he wants whole milk because it is healthier and tastes better and wants our son to have it so he grows to be strong.","your husband feels strongly that whole milk is the way to go. if you could find a way to get your husband on board with 1% or skim milk, things might be a bit different.  it sounds like you wish your husband was on board with the program. you think this could be a good fit for your son. your husband doesn't support the program. i can give you a handout to share with your husband that clearly shows why your son should not be drinking whole milk. why can't you just buy what's healthier? always fight for the best welfare of the child that is your child. drinking milk is good for health only and also give it your son to grow strong, but even more he may have to be support for the program i would suggest laying out your idea in a way that he can understand it. maybe the two of you can have a pros/cons conversation about whole milk versus other types of milks?"
i recently lost a friend to suicide.  i'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. how can i handle this better?,"<p>i urge you to seek some therapeutic help for this, and also to connect with others who knew your friend, because they're likely feeling the same way. suicide is difficult to understand, and those left behind have many mixed emotions that make their grief complicated and anguished. your friend either had an impulse that no one could stop, or they made a big decision that impacted everyone around them. there are other things you can do to cope with this, and it has to do with accepting your powerlessness to stop it, not blaming yourself, forgiving your friend, and finding meaning in their life and yours. you won't find that meaning in a bottle or a joint. i hope you reach out soon. :)</p>"
