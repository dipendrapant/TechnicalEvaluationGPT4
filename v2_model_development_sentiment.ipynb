'does counseling really do anything that can help people?', \"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.\\r\\nthe other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. \\r\\ni'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.\", 'my husband doesn’t trust me for some past we had. i know all marriages have their ups and downs,

they're trying to control me and won't let me grow.\", \"sometimes i can't stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. \\r\\nwhen i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. \\r\\nam i crazy? i don't think these thoughts are normal.\", \"i’ve been on 0.5 mg of xanax twice a day for the past month. it hasn't been helping me at all, but when i take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking i'm abusing them. i just have very big anxiety attacks. should i stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose? i'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.\", 'how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy? now that they’re gone, i feel sad. it’s been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.',

still married when she passed away. my friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. she has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me

feeling this way?\", \"i've been suppressing it for quite some time, but there are days when i can't make eye contact with her. i think she knows, and we both admitted there was some type of vibe, but the overall discussion was vague. i think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us. it's driving me crazy. as an act of expression, i have purchased a gift for her that's personalized. i haven't given it to her yet.\", \"we've been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker. i don't know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.\", \"i am not sure if i am depressed. i don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.\",
